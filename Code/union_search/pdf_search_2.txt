Abstract   N-gram features-------------------------------------------------------------------------------7 sentences

It introduces web N-gram features which, to our knowledge, are used for the ﬁrst time in
unsupervised WSD
~~~~~~~~~~~
 Test results concerning
nouns, adjectives and verbs show that web N-gram feature selection is a reliable alternative

part of speech, is used

The disambiguation method using N-gram features that we are presenting here is unsu-
pervised and uses counts collected from the web in a simple way, in order to rank candidates
~~~~~~~~~~~
 Web N-gram feature selection will prove
itself more efﬁcient than local-type features usage, and test results concerning nouns, adjec-
tives and verbs will recommend it as a reliable alternative to the other considered approach,
provided that a “quality list” of features, adapted to the part of speech, is used
~~~~~~~~~~~
 Specifically, we shall be providing a basic,
simple knowledge-lean disambiguation algorithm (that relying on the Naïve Bayes model),
with easily obtainable knowledge in the form of N-gram features

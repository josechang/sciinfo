Models for Predicting Stage in Head and Neck 
Squamous Cell Carcinoma using Proteomic and 

Transcriptomic Data 

Chanchala D. Kaddi and May D. Wang, Senior Member, IEEE 

 

Abstract—  Late  diagnosis  is  one  of  the  reasons  that  head  and 
neck  squamous  cell  carcinoma  (HNSCC)  patients  experience 
relative  5-year  survival  rates  ranging  from  40-66%.  The 
molecular-level  differences  between  early  and  advanced  stage 
HNSCC  may  provide  insight  into  therapeutic  targets  and 
strategies.  Previous  bioinformatics  studies  have  shown  mixed  or 
limited  results  in  identifying  gene  and  protein  markers  and  in 
developing models for discriminating between early and advanced 
stage  HNSCC.  Thus,  we  have  investigated  models  for  HNSCC 
stage  prediction  using  RNAseq  and  reverse  phase  protein  array 
data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and The Cancer Proteome 
Atlas. We systematically assessed individual and ensemble binary 
classifiers, using filter and wrapper feature selection methods, to 
develop several well-performing models. In particular, integrated 
models harnessing both data types consistently resulted in better 
performance.  This  study  identifies  informative  protein  and  gene 
feature  sets  which  may  increase  understanding  of  HNSCC 
progression.

I.  INTRODUCTION

including 

the  oral  cavity,  oropharynx, 

EAD  and  neck  squamous  cell  carcinoma  (HNSCC)  is  a 
cancer which arises in regions of the upper aerodigestive 
tract, 
larynx, 
hypopharynx,  and  tongue.  It  is  the  6th  most  prevalent  cancer 
worldwide, with approximately 600,000 new cases annually [1]. 
It comprises ~3% of cancers in the U.S., and in 2015, almost 
60,000 new cases and more than 12,000 deaths are expected [2]. 
Patient outcomes are highly associated with the stage at which 
HNSCC  is  detected:  for  early  stage  (stages  I  and  II)  disease, 
patients  have  60-95%  chance  of  successful  local  treatment, 
while  for  advanced  stage  (stages  III,  IV,  and  their  sub-types) 
disease,  patients  are  at  high  risk  for  recurrence  or  metastatic

disease 
the  molecular 
characteristics  of  different  stages  can  provide  insight  into  the 
mechanisms  of  HNSCC  progression,  and  may  help  in 
identifying more effective targets and strategies for treatment.  
Previous  research  studies  have  analyzed  gene  expression, 
proteomic,  and  metabolomic  data  individually  for  studying 
differences  between  HNSCC  stages,  with  mixed  results.  For 
example,  three  transcriptomic  studies  have  related  selected 
genes  and  gene  signatures  to  different  HNSCC  stages  [6-8], 
while  two  other  transcriptomic  studies  did  not  find  any 
discriminatory  genes  [9,  10].  A  recent  proteomic  study  using 
SELDI-TOF  mass  spectrometry  data  identified  eleven  m/z 
values  differentially  expressed  between  early-  and  late-stage 
oral  SCC,  but  a  satisfactory  predictive  model  could  not  be 
developed  [11].  Another  recent  study,  using  MALDI-TOF 
mass spectrometry data, identified several peaks that tended to 
correlate  with  clinical  disease  progression;  however,  no 
predictive  model  was  developed  [12].  A  metabolomic  study 
using  1H NMR data identified several metabolite markers that 
discriminated  between  early  and  advanced  stage  HNSCC 
samples  [13].  Additional  bioinformatics  studies  –  and  in 
particular,  the  development  of  predictive  models  that  harness 
multiple data types  –  may  help  to gain additional insight  into 
the progression from early to advanced HNSCC.  

In  a  recent  study,  we  investigated  how  quantitative 
functional proteomics, via reverse phase protein array (RPPA) 
data,  can  be  used  to  develop  predictive  models  for  HNSCC 
stage  [14].  RPPA  data  is  acquired  by  probing  a  sample  with 
antibodies  against  specific  proteins  with  regard  to  their 
activation states. With respect to HNSCC, RPPA data has been 
used  to  identify  differentially  expressed  proteins  between 
cancer  and  normal  samples  [15]  and  to  identify  proteins 
affected  by  the  presence  of  an  anti-invasion  compound  in 
nasopharyngeal carcinoma [16]. RPPA data has been applied to 
build predictive models for several other cancer types. Recent 
examples  include  for  prognosis  [17],  drug  response  [18],  and 
risk of recurrence [19] in breast cancer; for treatment response 
in  ovarian  cancer 
in 
non-small-cell lung cancer [21].  

for  drug  sensitivity 

[20];  and 

In this paper, we extend our previous work by performing a 
more  in-depth  analysis  of  RPPA  data  to  improve  model 
performance  in  discriminating  between  early  and  advanced 
stage HNSCC. In addition, we expand upon previous efforts by 
(i) developing predictive models for the same patient set using 
RNAseq  data,  and  by  (ii)  performing  integrated  analysis  of 
RPPA  and  RNAseq  data  through  functional  assessment  and

to  develop  a  set  of  improved  predictive  models,  and  thereby 
gather  additional  insight  into  HNSCC  progression  across 
multiple biological scales.  

II.  METHODS 

A.  Data  

 

[22] 

Atlas 

(TCPA) 

RPPA  data  for  HNSCC  was  downloaded  from  The  Cancer 
at 

Proteome 
http://bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/main/TCPA:Overview. 
This dataset consists of 212 patient samples and measures the 
response  to  187  antibodies.  TCPA  provides  a  proteomic 
complement  to  The  Cancer  Genome  Atlas  (TCGA)  [23]  at 
http://cancergenome.nih.gov/,  where  clinical,  transcriptomic, 
and genomic data for the same patients are available. RNAseq 
data  (Version  2)  for  HNSCC  was  downloaded  from  TCGA. 
Data was available for 210 of the same patients.  

The downloaded RPPA data had been normalized and protein 
expression had been quantified using the “Supercurve Fitting” 
method. The details of these pre-processing steps are described 
in [22, 24]. In TCPA, antibodies are grouped into three classes: 
‘validated’,  ‘under  evaluation’,  and  ‘use  with  caution.’  To 
perform a more conservative analysis, only those proteins with 
antibodies  described  as  ‘validated’  in  both  [22,  24]  were 
utilized in this study. 113 proteins were considered for further 
analysis. In TCGA, RNAseq (Version 2) data has been aligned 
using  MapSplice  and  quantified  using  RSEM  [25,  26].  This 
dataset  describes  20,531  genes.  The  un-normalized  data  was 
used  for  differential  expression  analysis  and  the  normalized 
data was used for classification. 

The clinical data for the 212 patients was downloaded from 
TCGA. Pathological stage information was used to divide the 
RPPA  and  RNAseq  datasets  into  two  groups:  patients  with 
early stage (stage I and II) cancer, and patients with advanced 
stage  (stage  III,  IVA,  IVB)  cancer.  Pathological  state  was 
unavailable  for  12  patients,  so  clinical  stage  was  substituted. 
One  patient  for whom  the  pathological  stage  was  unavailable 
and  the  clinical  stage  was  IVC  was  not  considered,  because 
unlike the other advanced cases, stage IVC involves metastatic 
disease. For RPPA, the early stage group contained 50 patients, 
and the advanced stage group contained 161 patients. The two 

patients for whom RNAseq data was unavailable were both of 
advanced pathological stage.  

B.  Predictive Modeling 

Four  individual  binary  classification  methods  and  two 
ensemble  classification  methods  were 
tested:  k-nearest 
neighbors  (KNN),  support  vector  machine  (SVM),  naïve 
Bayes, decision tree, Adaboost, and bagging / Random Forests. 
Optimal  parameters  for  each  model  were  selected  via  grid 
search  and  nested  cross-validation.  Table  I  lists  the  range  of 
parameters  tested  for  each  model,  and  Fig.  1  describes  the 
3×5×10  nested  cross-validation  scheme.  Optimization  was 
performed with respect to the Matthews correlation coefficient 
(MCC). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is also reported 
for the model having the maximum mean MCC. Analyses were 
performed using MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick MA).  

C.  Feature Selection 

Three alternative feature selection methods were tested: two 

filter approaches and one wrapper approach.  

The first filter method was based on differential expression. 
For  RPPA  data,  the  Wilcoxon  rank-sum  test  was  applied  to 
identify  proteins  with  significantly  different  expression 
between the early and advanced stage groups. Multiple testing 
corrections  were  applied  by  calculating  the  FDR  for  each 
protein, using the method of Benjamini and Hochberg through 
the  R  package  p.adjust.  To  obtain  a  less  conservative  initial 
feature  set,  clinical  stage  was  used  to  obtain  a  differentially 
expressed  protein  list.  This  yielded  11  proteins  with  FDR 
values  ≤  0.05,  including  the  five  proteins  found  when  only 
pathological stage was used. A comprehensive examination of 
this  feature  space  was  performed  by  considering  alternative 
classification models for every combination of the 11 features, 
i.e.,  ∑ (  
 feature  sets  were  considered.  For 
RNAseq  data,  differential  expression  analysis  was  performed 
using  two  alternative  tools,  edgeR  and  EBSeq,  of  which  the 
latter uses Bayesian methods [27, 28]. For a threshold of FDR ≤ 
0.05, edgeR identified 495 genes and EBSeq found 267 genes. 
These  two  lists  had  108  genes  in  common.  Due  to  the  large 
number  of  differentially  expressed  genes  identified  by  each 
method, comprehensive investigation of the feature space was 
not  possible.  Instead,  model  performances  were  compared 
across  four  feature  sets:  each  differential  expression  result

individually, the 108 common genes, and the 654 genes in the 
union of the selections of both methods.  

The second filter method was mRMR (minimum redundancy 
maximum relevance), implemented using the FEAST toolbox 
[29-31]. The performance of each model was optimized for up 
to the top 50 features. The RNAseq data contained 1,414,819 
unique  count  values,  and  the  vast  majority  of  values  were 
observed  only  once.  Due  to  this  high  dynamic  range  and 
memory limitations, the count values of the unscaled RNAseq 
data were binned prior to performing mRMR.  The number of 
binned  count  levels  was  chosen  to  balance  performance  and 
computational  cost;  30,000  binned  levels  were  the  best 
alternative given the available computational resources.   

In 

the  wrapper  approach,  sequential  forward  feature 
selection  (SFS)  was  performed.  Model  performance  was 
optimized for up to the top 20 features. Due to the large number 
of  genes  in  the  RNAseq  data,  SFS  was  performed  only  after 
initial  filtering  based  on  differential  expression.  The  input  to 
SFS was the 654 genes found to be differentially expressed by 
edgeR and EBSeq in combination.   

D.  Data Scaling 

Due to the high dynamic range of features in RNAseq data, 
two  data  scaling  methods  were  tested.  In  the  first  –  denoted 
scaled  (1)  –  each  feature  was  scaled  by  dividing  by  the 
maximum value observed for that feature across any sample. In 
the second –  denoted scaled (2) –  each feature was scaled by 
subtracting its mean and dividing by its standard deviation, as 
suggested in [32]. The predictive modeling results for RNAseq 
with SFS are from unscaled data. For the differential expression 
and mRMR feature selection techniques, the best result among 
the two alternative scaling choices and unscaled data is shown.  

E.  Integrated Analysis 

One  of  the  fundamental  goals  of  systems  biology  is  to 
integrate  information  from  multiple  levels  of  biological 
complexity  in  order  to  increase  actionable  biological  and 
clinical  knowledge.  However,  this  is  a  very  challenging  task. 
Several studies have demonstrated the lack of linear correlation 
between  transcriptomic  and  proteomic  data;  thus,  models 
developed by integrating mRNA and protein features in some 
manner  may  potentially  show  improved  performance  over 
models  using  individual  data  types  only.  In  a  recent  review, 
Haider  and  Pal  discussed  eight  frameworks  for  performing 
integrated analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data: union 
of  data  types,  comparison  of  functional  contexts,  topological 

network  analysis,  merging  datasets  in  individual  domains, 
missing  value  estimation,  multiple  regression  analysis, 
clustering, and dynamic modeling [33]. Due to the constraints 
of  the  available  data,  the  techniques  of  merging  datasets  in 
individual  domains,  missing  value  estimation,  multiple 
regression analysis, and dynamic modeling are not possible. In 
this study, we examine model development based on the first 
two remaining methods: combination of the two data types and 
the results of functional assessment.  

In the first case, RPPA and scaled RNAseq data were naively 
combined into a composite dataset. One dataset contained 221 
features  (113  RPPA  and  the  108  common  RNAseq  features) 
and the  other contained 767 features  (113 RPPA  and the 654 
union RNAseq features). SVM, KNN, and decision tree models 
with SFS were constructed using nested CV, with a maximum 
of 20 features. The better result among the two RNAseq scaling 
methods is reported.  

in 

to  RNAseq  and  RPPA  features 

In  the  second  case,  functional  analysis  of  the  genes 
corresponding 
the 
best-performing models was performed using DAVID [34, 35] 
and the Reactome Analysis Tool [36]. We hypothesized that, if 
an  ensemble  of  these  models  was  created,  individual  models 
representing  different  functional  categories  would  yield 
better-performing ensembles. This was tested by systematically 
evaluating all possible ensembles from nine SFS models: SVM, 
KNN,  naïve  Bayes,  decision  tree,  and  Adaboost  using  RPPA 
data,  and  SVM,  KNN,  decision  tree,  and  Adaboost  using 
RNAseq data. Ensemble decisions followed a majority voting 
scheme,  and  mean  MCC  values  were  compared  across  100 
repetitions of 10-fold CV.  

III.  RESULTS 

A.  Predictive Model Performance 

Table II shows the predictive model performance of the six 
classifiers  on  the  RPPA  data.  In  general,  performance  is 
moderate,  with  several  models  achieving  mean  MCC  values 
greater  than  0.4  and  AUC  values  greater  than  0.7.  The  best 
performing RPPA model was SVM with SFS feature selection. 
The  SVM  models  outperformed  the  other  classifiers  for  all 
feature  selection  methods  on  the  RPPA  dataset,  and  the  SFS 
models outperformed the other feature selection methods for all 
classifiers.  The  naïve  Bayes  and  KNN  models  were  the  next 
best  in  performance,  while  the  decision  tree  models  did  not 
perform  as  well.  The  two  ensemble  classifiers  showed 
markedly  different  performance.  For  mRMR  and  SFS,

Adaboost  outperformed  the  decision  tree  models,  although  it 
did not perform as well as the other individual classifiers. The 
Random Forests classifier gave surprisingly poor performance 
for the RPPA data, with an MCC value close to zero.  

Table  III  shows  the  predictive  model  performance  of  five 
classifiers  on  the  RNAseq  data.  The  best  RNAseq  models, 
which achieve mean MCC values greater than 0.6, outperform 
the  best  RPPA  models.  Again,  the  SFS  models  outperformed 
the  other  feature  selection  methods  for  all  classifiers.  The 
highest  performing  RNAseq  model  was  KNN  with  SFS;  the 
Adaboost and SVM models with SFS performed almost as well 
in  terms  of  MCC,  though  the  SVM  AUC  value  was 
non-informative. The Random Forests model for RNAseq data 
showed better mean performance than that for RPPA data, but it 
also had a large standard deviation. For differential expression 
and  mRMR  feature  selection,  the  SVM  models  outperformed 
the other classifiers in terms of MCC. Under these two feature 
selection  methods,  the  decision  tree  and  Adaboost  models 
showed  better  performance  for  RNAseq  data  than  for  RPPA 
data,  but  KNN  was  not  notably  different.  In  the  majority  of 
cases, scaled data showed better performance, and the second 

scaling method was more often better than the first.   

B.  Commonly Selected Features and Functional Analysis 

The  existence  of  well-performing  models  implies  that  the 
selected features are of functional importance. The five RPPA 
SFS models were compared, and 11 features were selected in at 
least  two  models.  All  of  these  have  been  associated  with 
HNSCC  in  the  literature:  AR  [37],  C-Raf  [38],  CDK1  [39], 
Cyclin  B1  [40],  MAPK_pT202_Y204  [1],  N-Cadherin  [41], 
PDK1  [42],  PI3K-p85  [43],  VEGFR2  [44],  c-Jun_pS73  [45], 
and  p27_pT198  [46].  In  particular,  AR  was  selected  by  four 
models, CDK1 and Cyclin B1 by three, and the others by two. 
Table IV shows the number of total common features between 
each  model  pair.  The  low  counts  show  that  some  models 
achieved comparable performance using very different feature 
sets.  Even  greater  feature  diversity  was  observed  for  the 
RNAseq SFS models. Among the four models, 52 features were 
present  in  total,  but  only  two  features  were  selected  in  more 
than one model: FAM27B and KRTAP17-1.  

Functional  analysis  of  the  SFS  feature  sets  was  performed 
via  DAVID  and  Reactome.  DAVID  was  used  to  find 

The number of features, GO functional annotations, and pathways (KEGG and Reactome) in common between different models are indicated.

significantly enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms and KEGG 
pathways, while Reactome also returned significant pathways. 
In terms of specific features and GO terms, the five RPPA SFS 
models  were  diverse,  with  relatively  few  commonalities. 
However, many common pathways were found, both  through 
KEGG  and  through  Reactome.  Seven  KEGG  pathways  were 
common  among  the  SVM,  decision  tree,  and  KNN  RPPA 
models.  These  consisted  of  three  signaling  pathways:  ErbB, 
neurotrophin,  and  insulin  signaling,  and  four  cancer-related 
pathways:  pathways  in  cancer,  colorectal  cancer,  pancreatic 
cancer,  and  chronic  myeloid  leukemia.  Reactome  returned 
many  more  significant  pathways  than  DAVID,  and  46 
pathways  were  in  common  among  all  five  models.  Most  of 
these related to signal transduction and mitotic progression.  

Notably,  there  were  no  results  in  DAVID  for  the  four 
RNAseq feature lists from the SFS models. Reactome returned 
results for only the KNN RNAseq model. The nine pathways 
identified  fell 
into  four  categories:  regulation  of  gene 
expression  and  development  in  beta  cells,  visual  transduction 
and phototransduction, retinoid metabolism and transport, and 
the synthesis of bile acids and bile salts. Retinoids are important 
therapeutics  for  many  cancer  types,  including  HNSCC  [47], 
and recent studies have shown that bile acids may be associated 
with head and neck cancer [48, 49].  

The  results  for  developing  SFS  models  based  on  naïve 
combination of the RPPA and RNAseq datasets are shown in 
Table  V.    All  of  the  models  outperformed  the  corresponding 
RPPA SFS models for the same classification method in terms 
of mean MCC values. However, only the SVM models showed 
improvement over the RNAseq SFS models as well. Moreover, 
only  the  models  for  the  smaller  composite  dataset  (221 
features) utilized both RPPA and RNAseq features. The RPPA 
features selected by the SVM model for the smaller composite 
dataset were Cyclin B1 and p38_pT180_Y182. Cyclin B1 was 
one of the commonly selected features among the RPPA SFS 
models; p38 is a mitogen-activated protein kinase that has also 
been associated with HNSCC [50]. The models for the larger 
composite  dataset  (767  features)  selected  only  RNAseq 
features.  Thus,  the  improvement  in  MCC  seen  for  the 
best-performing  model  (SVM  with  the  larger  composite 
dataset) cannot be attributed to integrating data types, but may 
be due in part to using scaled data.  

Fig. 2 compares the performance of single-data type models 
(RPPA and RNAseq) with ensembles comprised of only RPPA 
models,  only  RNAseq  models,  or  both.  The  last  category 
contains  all  possible  ensembles  with  three  to  nine  member 
models. Results represent the mean performance of 10-fold CV 
for  the  209  common  patients  in  the  RPPA  and  RNAseq 
datasets,  across  100  repetitions.  The  best  single-data  type 
ensembles  had  higher  mean  MCC  values  than  individual 
models of that data type. Additionally, combination ensembles 
of multiple sizes were found which had better performance than 
any of the single-data type ensembles.  

The  performances  of  the  RPPA-only  ensembles  were 
compared in terms of the previous functional analysis results. 
For  example,  in  one  iteration  of  10-fold  CV,  the  best 
performing  RPPA-only  ensemble  (SVM,  KNN,  Adaboost) 
achieved  a  mean  MCC  value  of  0.54,  and  50  Reactome

in both data type and component model type, outperform RPPA-only and RNAseq-only models.

pathways  were  in  common  among  the  three  feature  sets.  The 
worst-performing ensemble (SVM, Naïve Bayes, decision tree) 
had  a  mean  MCC  of  0.25  and  86  Reactome  pathways  in 
common.  Among  all  of 
the  RPPA-only  ensembles,  a 
correlation  of  -0.44  was  observed  between  the  mean  MCC 
values  and  the  number  of  Reactome  pathways  in  common 
among the ensemble member models. 

While  the  RNAseq  ensembles  had  the  highest  median 
performance, several combined RPPA and RNAseq ensembles 
had  higher  overall  performance.  Among  all  of  the  ensembles 
tested  –  RPPA  only,  RNAseq  only,  and  combination  –  27 
ensembles were identified which had better performance than 
the best-performing individual RNAseq model in more than 90 
of  the  100  CV  repetitions.  Of  these,  two  were  RNAseq-only 
ensembles.  Another 
two  were  combination  ensembles 
containing three and four models, respectively, in which only 
RNAseq models were chosen as members. The other 23 notable 
ensembles  all  contained  both  RPPA  and  RNAseq  member 
models.  

Among these 23 was the best performing ensemble overall, 
which  achieved  a mean  (±  standard deviation)  MCC value of 
0.80 (±0.14). This is higher than any of the model performances 
reported for previous tests. Steiger’s Z test was used to compare 
the MCC performance of this ensemble model with those of the 
highest  performing  RNAseq  (KNN)  and  composite  (SVM) 
models  [51].  In  both  cases,  the  improvement  was  statistically 
significant  (p  <  0.01).  This  particular  ensemble  incorporated 
the  Adaboost  RPPA  SFS  model  and  the  SVM,  KNN,  and 
Adaboost  RNAseq  SFS  models.  Leave-one-out  analysis  of 
these  four  models  revealed  that  the  KNN  RNAseq  model 
contributed  the  most  to  the  ensemble  performance,  followed 
closely  by  the  SVM  RNAseq  model.  Omission  of  either  of 
these  models  from  the  ensemble  decreased  the  mean  MCC 
performance to below 0.60. The contribution of the Adaboost 
RNAseq  and  Adaboost  RPPA  models  was  not  as  great,  with 
their omission leading to mean MCC values between 0.71-0.75.   

IV.  DISCUSSION 

In  this  study,  we  have  built  upon  our  previous  work  on 
modeling differences between HNSCC pathological stages. An 
in-depth  analysis  of  HNSCC  RPPA  data  was  performed  by 
implementing six different classification methods, using nested 
cross-validation  to  optimize  parameters,  and  testing  three 
alternative feature selection methods. This supervised approach 
contrasts  with  previous  HNSCC  studies  using  RPPA  data, 
which have conducted unsupervised and differential expression 
analyses  [15,  16].  It  also  differs  from  previous  supervised 
studies  on  RPPA  data  [17,  18]  in  two  ways.  First,  this  study 
assesses the performances of several different combinations of 
feature selection methods and classification algorithms in order 
to identify potentially relevant protein feature sets. Second, this 
study  builds  upon  current  research  by  developing  integrated 
proteomic and transcriptomic models, and comparing them to 
RPPA-only  and  RNAseq-only  models.  In  particular,  we 
performed  two  types  of  integrated  analysis:  one  by  direct 
combination  of  RPPA  and  RNAseq  data,  and  another  by 
constructing  ensemble  models  using  both  data  types.  To  our 
knowledge, this is the first such comparative, integrated study 
for modeling progression in HNSCC.  

From  a  modeling  perspective,  we  identified  the  integrated 
ensemble approach with both RPPA and RNAseq models as the 
best overall. The top-performing model for predicting HNSCC 
pathological stage was obtained using this approach, and had a 
significantly  higher  MCC  value  than  the  best  performing 
individual RNAseq and composite models. Notably, modeling 
results  appear  to  support  the  initial  conjecture  that  less 
functional agreement among the feature sets of member models 
will  be  associated  with  better  performance.  First, 
the 
RNAseq-only  and  the  combination  RPPA  and  RNAseq 
ensembles outperformed the RPPA-only ensembles. Second, a 
moderate  negative  correlation  was  observed  between  the 
performances  of  RPPA-only  ensembles  and  the  numbers  of 
common  Reactome  pathways  among  ensemble  members. 
These observations indicate that higher-performing ensembles 
tended  to  be  more  functionally  diverse  in  terms  of  member 
model  feature  sets.  However, 
this 
observation  should  be  explored  further,  particularly  for  the 
integrated  ensembles,  because  they  highlight  components  of 
complex  gene  and  protein  networks.  Investigation  on  larger 
datasets,  as  well  as  assessment  using  ensemble  diversity 
measures and different ensemble construction techniques [52], 
are  directions  for  further  research.    The  comparison  of 
performance  trends  with  those  of  other  cancers,  particularly 
cancers  which  have 
to  have 
molecular-level  similarities  to  HNSCC,  may  also  yield 
additional insight [53]. 

implications  of 

the 

recently  been 

shown 

A  related  question  of  interest  is  performing  multi-class 
classification to study bio-molecular expression patterns among 
individual HNSCC stages, rather than grouping them into early 
and advanced disease. Another is investigating the differences 
between  normal  and  early  stage  HNSCC  samples.  For 
investigating  these  questions,  the  availability  of  sufficiently 
large – in terms of patients and features – public datasets is a 
constraint. While  matched tumor and normal RNAseq  data is 
available  on  TCGA  for  HNSCC,  RPPA  data  for  matched 
normal  samples  is  yet  unavailable.  In  addition,  an  inherent 
limitation of RPPA data is that only a selected set of proteins is 
measured.  A  larger  set  of  proteins  could  enable  discovery,  in 
that proteins which were previously not implicated in HNSCC 
–  or  cancer  in  general  –  may  be  identified  as  informative 
features through modeling. TCPA is currently in the process of 
extending their antibody set to cover 500 proteins [22], which 
will  help  to  address  this  limitation  to  some  extent.  The 
availability  of  more  extensive  proteomic  data  for  HNSCC 
through mass spectrometry is a related promising avenue. The 
Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), like 
TCPA,  is  currently  building  a  proteomic  complement  to 
TCGA. CPTAC hosts a library of LC-MS/MS data from tumor 
samples  that  are  also  in  TCGA.  At  the  time  of  writing,  data 
from breast cancer, ovarian cancer, colon adenocarcinoma, and 
rectum adenocarcinoma have been released. Future availability 
of such data for HNSCC would be valuable to researchers.  

From a systems  biology perspective, investigating multiple 
types of –omic datasets to gain insight into disease processes is 
an  important  area  of  research.  Numerous  individual  proteins 
and genes selected as features in well-performing models in this 
study  have  been  previously  associated  with  HNSCC  in  the 
literature, including in a recent large-scale study by The Cancer 
Genome Atlas Network [54]. Additionally, functional analysis

of the features selected in the top-performing models revealed 
notable  patterns.  Many  processes  –  e.g.,  signal  transduction 
pathways  including  those  through  EGFR  and  ERBB2,  and 
events  related  to  mitotic  progression  –  were  commonly 
represented  among  the  RPPA  model  features.  The  RNAseq 
feature sets were much more diverse, but some of the associated 
biological processes have still been linked with HNSCC in the 
literature.  

While this integrative modeling study of RPPA and RNAseq 
data  can  provide  guidance  for  further  research,  integration  in 
general should be interpreted with caution. Because RPPA is a 
tool  for  functional  proteomics,  it  is  several  biological  steps 
removed  from  the  mRNA  counts  measured  by  RNAseq,  and 
mRNA  is  itself  distinct  from  genome-level  factors.  Thus, 
further  investigation  into  additional  data  types  –  e.g.,  copy 
number  variations,  mutations,  DNA  methylation,  protein 
subunits  and  alternative  activation  states,  metabolites  –  is 
needed for drawing conclusions about the specific mechanisms 
underlying HNSCC progression. Appropriate comparison and 
combination of multiple data types will help to fill in the gaps 
and  provide  greater  insight  into  the  process  of  disease 
development.  By  harnessing  the  diverse  data  from  initiatives 
like  TCPA,  TCGA,  and  CPTAC,  bioinformatics  studies  can 
lead to better understanding of the molecular bases of HNSCC 
and other cancers.

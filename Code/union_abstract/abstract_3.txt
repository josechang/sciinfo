ABSTRACT
Translational control is crucial in the regulation of
gene expression and deregulation of translation is
associated with a wide range of cancers and hu-
man diseases. Ribosome proﬁling is a technique
that provides genome wide information of mRNA in
translation based on deep sequencing of ribosome
protected mRNA fragments (RPF). RPFdb is a com-
prehensive resource for hosting, analyzing and vi-
sualizing RPF data, available at www.rpfdb.org or
http://sysbio.sysu.edu.cn/rpfdb/index.html. The cur-
rent version of database contains 777 samples from
82 studies in 8 species, processed and reanalyzed by
a uniﬁed pipeline. There are two ways to query the
database: by keywords of studies or by genes. The
outputs are presented in three levels. (i) Study level:
including meta information of studies and repro-
cessed data for gene expression of translated mR-
NAs; (ii) Sample level: including global perspective
of translated mRNA and a list of the most translated
mRNA of each sample from a study; (iii) Gene level:
including normalized sequence counts of translated
mRNA on different genomic location of a gene from
multiple samples and studies. To explore rich in-
formation provided by RPF, RPFdb also provides
a genome browser to query and visualize context-
speciﬁc translated mRNA. Overall our database pro-
vides a simple way to search, analyze, compare, vi-
sualize and download RPF data sets.

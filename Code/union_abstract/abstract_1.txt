ABSTRACT 
When  search  results  against  digital  libraries  and  web  resources 
have  limited  metadata,  augmenting  them  with  meaningful  and 
stable  category  information  can  enable  better  overviews  and 
support  user  exploration.  This  paper  proposes  six  “fast-feature” 
techniques that use only features available in the search result list, 
such  as  title,  snippet,  and  URL,  to  categorize  results  into 
meaningful  categories.  They  use  credible  knowledge  resources, 
including  a  US  government  organizational  hierarchy,  a thematic 
hierarchy from the Open Directory Project (ODP) web directory, 
and personal browse histories, to add valuable metadata to search 
results.  In  three  tests  the  percent  of  results  categorized  for  five 
representative  queries  was  high  enough  to  suggest  practical 
benefits:  general  web  search  (76-90%),  government  web  search 
(39-100%), and the Bureau of Labor Statistics website (48-94%). 
An additional test submitted 250 TREC queries to a search engine 
and successfully categorized 66% of the top 100 using the ODP 
and  61%  of  the  top  350.  Fast-feature  techniques  have  been 
implemented in a prototype search engine. We propose research 
directions  to  improve  categorization  rates  and  make  suggestions 
about  how  web  site  designers  could  re-organize  their  sites  to 
support fast categorization of search results.

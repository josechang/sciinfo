Abstract
This paper is concerned with intelligent control for grasping and manipulation of an object by multi-fingered robot hands with rigid or
soft hemispheric finger ends that induce rolling contacts with the object. Even in the case of 2D motion like pinching by means of a pair of
multi-degrees of freedom robot fingers, there arises an interesting family of Lagrangeâs equations of motion with many geometric constraints,
which are under-actuated, redundant, and non-holonomic in some sense. Regardless of underactuation of dynamics, it is possible to find a class
of sensory feedback signals that realize secure grasp of an object together with control of object orientation. In regard to the secure grasping,
a problem of force/torque closure for 2D objects in a dynamic sense plays a crucial role. It is shown that proposed sensory feedback signals
satisfying the dynamic force/torque closure can be constructed without knowing object kinematic parameters and location of the mass center.
To prove the convergence of motion of the overall fingersâobject system under the circumstance of redundancy of joints, new concepts called
âstability on a manifoldâ and âasymptotic stability on a manifoldâ are introduced. Based on the results found for intelligent control of robotic
hands, the last two sections attempt to discuss why human multi-fingered hands can become so dexterous at grasping and object manipulation.

1. Introduction
In the early 1980s, âRoboticsâ was defined by Brady
(1984) as âthe intelligent connection of perception to
actionâ. It was also around the early 1980s that roboticists
dreamed enthusiastically about creating âintelligent robotsâ
through looking at successful employment of a number of
robot arms in automation processes and assembly lines in
factory. In that decade a variety of multi-fingered robot
hands were designed and made in some research institutes
and universities as reported in Shimoga (1996). However,
as surveyed by Shimoga (1996) and Bicchi (2000) in their
elaborate survey papers, use of multi-fingered hands has
been so far focused on enveloping grasp (or power grasp)
and therefore motion plannings for reaching and grasping
from kinematic analysis have been mainly investigated. Enveloping grasp can be realized without use of any sensory
feedback if the pressing force exerting on an object can be
adequately controlled. In fact, newborn babies can grasp a
thing by bending all fingers simultaneously in a reflexive
manner when it is placed on their palm. Hence, envelop-

ing grasp is called âreflexive graspâ in the developmental
psychology. In contrast, pinching motion by using a couple
of thumb and index (or middle) fingers is far intelligent,
because even babies of one or two years old are not yet
matured in pinching a thing stably and smoothly. Of course,
children at the age of starting school are matured enough to
pinch an object smoothly without measuring physical parameters of the object and location of the object mass center.
On the other hand, there is the vast literature on the
theme of immobilizability or form closure of 2D or 3D
objects by using a number of frictionless fingers (Faverjon
& Ponce, 1991; Markenscoff, Ni, & Papadimitriou, 1990;
Murray, Li, & Sastry, 1994; Nguyen, 1989). It is shown
by Czyzowics, Stojmenovic, and Urrutia (1991) that three
frictionless fingers suffice to immobilize any 2D object with
triangular shape but four fingers are necessary for immobilizing a parallelepiped. The former result was extended
by Rimon and Burdick (1995) to the case of 2D objects
closed by a generic smooth curve. In the framework of
âform closureâ, four frictionless fingers are necessary and
sufficient in general for realizing a form closure grasp of
2D polygonal objects (Mishra, Schwartz, & Sharin, 1987).
Furthermore, the knowledge of kinematic parameters of
an object and location of its mass center is implicitly assumed, or it is assumed that the mass density is uniformly

distributed inside the object. However, there is a dearth of
papers that discussed the problem of object-manipulation,
together with maintaining secure grasp with dynamic
force/torque balance of an object, from the viewpoint of
sensoryâmotor coordination, by analyzing actual motion
dynamics of the overall fingersâobject system (see Fig. 1).
Theoretically, object-manipulation seems to be contradictory to immobilizability of an object (see Fig. 2). In order to
manipulate an object by a pair of multi-degrees of freedom
(multi-DOF) fingers while maintaining secure grasp on it,
it is necessary to solve a problem of force/torque balance
(or closure) in a dynamic sense. At the same time, to realize dynamic force/torque balance for any polygonal object
by means of only two frictionless contacts, introduction
of rolling contacts by using hemi-spherical finger ends is
indispensable. As to the use of rolling contacts in grasping and object-manipulation, there are several papers (Cole
et al., 1988; Fearing, 1986; Paljug et al., 1994) though they
treated manipulation of an object by robot arms. Pioneering
papers by Cole, Hauser, and Sastry (1988) and Paljug, Yun,
and Kumar (1994) are however based on the computed
torque method and hence they assume implicitly the whole

knowledge of object kinematics and the measurement data
on location of the object mass center.
This paper is aiming at challenging the following two
problems: (1) dynamic force/torque balance of 2D polygonal objects under the effect of gravity force by using a pair
of rolling contacts and (2) concurrent realization of secure
grasp and orientation control of a polygonal object by using a
pair of multi-DOF fingers with hemi-spherical ends and a set
of feedforward and sensory feedback signals. The first problem is solved in a dynamic sense by controlling both the positions of contact points without knowing the mass center and
other kinematic parameters of the object. In relation to this,
differences in intelligence level of control signals to be constructed are introduced accordingly to the amount of prior
knowledge of the object. For example, if control can be constructed on the basis of known kinematic parameters of only
fingers and measurement data on finger joint angles and object rotational angles then it is said to be of intelligence level
1. In addition to the above knowledge and measurement data,
if control needs only rough estimates for the object mass and
width then it is said to be of intelligence level 2. The second
problem is solved in a dynamic sense by controlling both
the positions of contact points by using a sensory feedback
of intelligence level 1 in the case that motion of the overall
system is confined to a horizontal plane and of intelligence
level 2 in the case that the motion is confined to a vertical
plane and therefore affected directly by the gravity force.
Lagrangeâs equation of the overall fingersâobject system belongs to a class of nonlinear dynamics that are
under-actuated and redundant in DOF. In fact, control inputs do not enter directly into the object dynamics but exert
the finger dynamics through finger joints. Motion of the object should be controlled indirectly through four constraint
forces, two of which exert at the object in the direction
normal to the object surfaces and other two of which do in
the direction tangent to the surfaces. These four constraint
forces appear in the object dynamics in accompany with
Jacobian vectors of algebraic constraints with respect to
object position variables (x, y, Î¸), which form a linear sum
of four 2D wrench vectors. Redundancy of DOFs of the
overall system arises when the total degrees of freedom of
the overall system are greater than the number of physical
variables necessary and sufficient for description of a target
task. Traditionally as discussed in (Hollerbach & Suh, 1987;
Lenarcic, 1991; Scianicco & Sicilliano, 1996; Vukobratovic
& Kircanski, 1986), redundancy of DOFs incurs a problem
of illposedness of inverse kinematics. However, regardless
of such DOF-redundancy of the overall fingersâobject system, a family of sensory feedback signals is found, which,
together with angular-velocity feedbacks of finger joints
for damping shaping, renders in a natural way motion trajectories of the overall closed-loop system asymptotically
convergent to the target task. In the convergence proof, new
concepts named âstability on a manifoldâ and âasymptotic
stability on a manifoldâ play a crucial role. These concepts
seem to resemble the conventional concept of stability

for descriptor systems or constrained mechanical systems
(MĂźller, 1998). However, the formers differ logically from
the latter because in the former problems the target equilibrium states form by themselves a lower-dimensional manifold caused by DOF-redundancy of the closed-loop system.
In the final two sections, some important relations of
the obtained results with developmental psychology and
sensoryâmotor coordination in physiology are discussed.
In particular, the so-called Bernsteinâs problem (Whiting,
1984; Hinton, 1984) will be discussed from the viewpoint
of sensoryâmotor coordination. Finally, it will be claimed
that Bernsteinâs problem may be partially resolved in a natural way by introduction of the concepts of âstability and
asymptotic stability on a manifoldâ and finding of a family
of effective sensory feedback signals without solving inverse
kinematics.

2. Dynamics of pinching
Dynamics of a pair of dual three DOF fingers pinching
an object with non-parallel (or parallel) flat surfaces (see
Fig. 3) can be derived on the basis of Hamiltonâs variational
principle:

and qi = (qi1 , qi2 , qi3 )T , z = (x, y, Î¸)T , g is the gravity
constant, M denotes the mass of the object, Hi (qi ) the inertia
matrix for finger i, H0 = diag(M, M, I) with I the inertia
moment of the object around its mass center, and Pi stands
for the potential energy for finger i. Here, meanings of basic
physical parameters and variables are expressed in Fig. 3.
The equality (5) signifies holonomic constraints of contacts
between object surfaces and finger ends and another equality
(7) rolling constraints of contacts. The latter follows from
taking integral of equality dri Ďi /dt = âdYi /dt, that signifies
equivalence of two velocities of the contact point specified
by angle Ďi on the sphere of finger i and by position Yi on
the object surface, where c0i denotes an integral constant,
Ďi = Ď/2 + { }, and here the content of bracket { } stands for
the bracket of Eq. (7). The normal contact force fi appears
to be normal to the object surface as shown and the rolling
contact force Îťi tangent to the surface as a constraint force as
shown in Fig. 3. Hamiltonâs principle renders the following
dynamics of the overall fingersâobject system:

3. Dynamic force/torque balance
In order to stop motion of the object, it is necessary to
set normal contact forces fi (i = 1, 2) and tangential shear
forces Îťi (i = 1, 2) to satisfy
AÎť + Mgey = 0

Y1 â Y2 = (l1 â l2 ) tan Î¸0

(15)

as seen from Eq. (13). Let us define a dynamic force/torque
balance problem in the following way: To find a quadruplet
Îť = (f1 , f2 , Îť1 , Îť2 )T by dynamically changing locations of
contact positions through rollings so that Îť tends to satisfy
Eq. (15) as t â â without loosing contacts (that is, f1 > 0
and f2 > 0 for any t âĽ 0). Possible movement of contact
locations on the object surfaces can be interpreted as that
both lengths Y1 and Y2 can be changed on each corresponding flat surface of the object by each rolling.
To find a solution to the problem it is convenient to introduce the following 4 Ă 1 vectors:

a1 = (cos Î¸0 , cos Î¸0 , sin Î¸0 , sin Î¸0 )T
(16)
a2 = (â sin Î¸0 , sin Î¸0 , cos Î¸0 , âcos Î¸0 )T

are maintained during maneuvering the pair of fingers, then
Îť becomes a solution to the force/torque balance problem
in a dynamic sense. In order to ensure the existence of such
a positive fd that yields positiveness of fi (i = 1, 2), it is
necessary to find a condition under which the value of Îž
does not vanish. Firstly, let us consider a convex polygonal
object as shown in Fig. 4. In this case, even if the mass desity is not uniformly distributed, the mass center Oc.m. is
located inside the object. Then, it is possible to find the maximum inscribed circle contained in the polygon as shown
in Fig. 4. Then, it is possible to find a set of at least three
contact points {Pi } between the circle and the polygon and
corresponding line segments {si } where Pi is located on the
segment si . For example, in the case of Fig. 4 we find three
contact points {P1 , P3 , P4 } and line segments {s1 , s3 , s4 }.
Then, at least one pair of contact points {P1 , P3 , P4 }, say
{P1 , P3 }, can be found such that the angle Î¸1 (= â P1 P0 P3 )
between the corresponding line segments {s1 , s3 } is less than
or equal to Ď/3 radian. It is impossible to find such a triplet
of line segments {si } that, together with their rectilinear extensions, can form a triangle, then it is possible to find a
pair of line segments {sj , sk } which are in parallel to each

Since the four vectors ax , ay , a1 and a2 are orthognal to each

other. This latter case can be reduced to a special trivial case
when Î¸0 (Î¸1 /2) = 0 and treated in the same way as the former general case such that 0 < Î¸0 â¤ Ď/6. At the same time,
note that the mass center of the object must lie in the triangle formed by extending each line segment of {s1 , s3 , s4 }
straight from its both ends as shown in Fig. 4 and it is possible to draw a straight line lc through Oc.m. such that the
angle between lc and s1 is Î¸1 /2(= Î¸0 ) and the other angle
between lc and s3 is also Î¸1 /2. Then, it is evident from Fig. 4
that the straight line connecting contact points P1 and P3 becomes perpendicular to the line lc . By selecting such points
P1 and P3 as rolling contact points O1 and O2 between
finger-tips and the object, it is possible to state the following
result:
Theorem 1. For any given convex polygonal object, it is
possible to find at least a pair of line segments {si , sj } and a
pair of contact points O1 and O2 inside si and sj respectively
such that the selection of contact forces Îť = (f1 , f2 , Îť1 , Îť2 )
at O1 and O2 as defined by Eq. (17) satisfies Eq. (20) with
Y1 âY2 = 0 and inequalities (22) with an appropriate choice
for fd > 0, that is, at contact points O1 and O2 it is possible to select a quadraplet Îť that forms a solution to the
force/torque balance.
Even if the given polygonal object is not convex but it has
two rectilinear edges {s1 , s2 } that are in parallel or the angle
Î¸1 of which is less than or equal to Ď/3, it is possible to find
contact points O1 and O2 lying on s1 and s2 respectively and
a quadraplet of contact forces (f1 , f2 , Îť1 , Îť2 ) that satisfy
force/torque balance for the object, provided that the mass
center Oc.m. is inside the region formed by the two line
segments s1 and s2 and their extensions (see Fig. 5) and
there exists a rectilinear line perpendicular to lc that crosses
at points O1 and O2 with edges s1 and s2 respectively, where
lc is a straight line passing through Oc.m. and forming the
same angle Î¸0 = Î¸1 /2 with rectilinear edges s1 and s2 (see
Fig. 5). It is evident from Fig. 5 that the magnitude of Îž is
always positive because it is equivalent to the length of the
line segment O1 O2 .

4. Intelligence levels of sensoryâmotor coordination
control
Now consider a problem for finding control signals
ui (i = 1, 2) which control locations of contact positions O1
and O2 and affect motion of the object through the motion
Eqs. (9)â(12) of the fingers and object for attaining a still
state satisfying force/torque balance. Then, it is crucial to
take into consideration what kind of knowledge about the
object should be assumed. It is reasonable to assume the
knowledge about kinematic parameters of the fingers including finger link lengths and inertia moments together with
radius of finger-end spheres. It is also reasonable to assume
that all finger joint angles qij can be measured in sufficient
precision and their conrresponding angular velocities qĚij are
available in real-time. Moreover, we asuume that either contact locations Oi (i = 1, 2) can be measured by visual or tactile sensing or both angles between line segments si (i = 1, 2)
and the vertical line lc can be measured by optical distance
sensors (see Fig. 6). In either case, it is possible to see that
angles Î¸0 and Î¸ can be easily calculated from measurement
data on qij . In addition, we assume only the a priori knowledge that the object sides in which there arise contact points
are flat.
Now, we distinguish among intelligence levels of control
signals according to whether any other prior knowledge on
the object is required or not.
(1) If control signals ui (i = 1, 2) can be constructed on
the basis of only known kinematic parameters of fingers
and measurement data on Î¸ and Î¸0 , the pair (u1 , u2 ) is
said to be control of intelligence level 1.
(2) In addition to the above knowledge and measurement
data, if construction of control signals ui (i = 1, 2) need
only rough estimates for object kinematic parameters
(mass M and lengths l1 and l2 ), the pair (u1 , u2 ) is said
to be control of intelligence level 2.
(3) If it needs further exact knowledge about the object mass
M and lengths li (i = 1, 2), then it is said to be control
of intelligence level 3.
(4) If it needs whole knowledge about the object kinematics, locations of the object mass center, and whole

measurement data on the position (x, y) of the mass center Oc.m. , it is said to be control of intelligence level 4.
First consider the case that motion of the overall
fingersâobject system is confined to a horizontal plane and
thereby is not affected by the gravity force. In this case,
Lagrangeâs equation of motion of the overall system is reduced to the expression of Eqs. (9)â(12) by regarding as
gi (qi ) = 0 for i = 1, 2 and Mg = 0. Force/torque balance is
realized simply by setting M = 0 in Eq. (17), which results
in
fi = fd cos Î¸0 ,

in t is non-positive definite as shown in Eq. (29). Regardless of this property, E does not play a role of Lyapunovâs
function because it is neither positive definite in R18 of
the state variables x = (q1T , q2T , x, y, Î¸)T and xĚ nor positive
definite in the 10-dimensional manifold M10 = {(x, xĚ) :
Qi = 0, Ri = 0, QĚi = 0, RĚi = 0, i = 1, 2}. However,

5. Concurrent realization of dynamic force/torque
closure and orientation control
Even if a robot hand has only two fingers with
multi-degrees of freedom, it cannot only grasp a rigid
object and maintain a secure grasp on it but also control the rotational angle Î¸ of the object at specified value
Î¸ = Î¸d without knowing object kinematic parameters and
location of the object mass center. That is, it is possible
to find additional sensory feedback signals with intelligence level 1 that, together with control signals defined by
Eq. (24), concurrently realize dynamic force/torque balance for the object and orientation control of the object.
In fact, for a given desired orientation angle Î¸d for the object, define additional sensory feedback signals uÎ¸i in the
forms:

includes Y1 + Y2 and l1 + l2 which cannot be calculated
without knowing object kinematic parameters and location
of the object mass center. However, it is interesting to note
that Îž can be calculated by another expression
Îž = (x02 â x01 )cos Î¸ â (y02 â y01 ) sin Î¸

requires only the measurement of qij and Î¸ together with the
sizes of finger links. Thus the overall desired control signals

a reference still state with contacts. In fact, computer simulation verifies this theoretical result on convergence of the
solution trajectory. However, in this case the speed of convergence of Y1 â Y2 is considerably retarded in comparison
with that in the case of stable grasping by using only ufi
(i = 1, 2) of Eq. (24). This also causes slow convergence of
the orientation angle Î¸(t) to Î¸d even if Î˛ > 0 is adequately
chosen. In order to accelerate the convergence speed in the

closed-loop system of motion equations of the overall fingersâobject system when control signals ui = uĚi

7. Stability on a manifold
As shown in Eq. (29), the nonnegative quantity E defined
by Eq. (30) is non-increasing, but it is not positive definite
in the state space R18 = {(x, xĚ)}. However, a trajectory of
solution to the closed-loop system of Eqs. (26) and (28) lies
on the constraint manifold M10 defined as

Now, choose and fix a steady state (x0 , 0) â M4 which expresses a still state with satisfying force/torque balance, and

of Eqs. (26) and (28) starting from an arbitrarily given initial state (x(0), xĚ(0)) in a neighborhood of the steady state

At the same time, it is also convenient to define neighborhoods of (x0 , 0) on the manifold M10 as
N10 (Î´) = {(x, xĚ) : E(x, xĚ) â¤ Î´2 }
where E is defined in Eq. (30).
7.1. Stability on a manifold
If for a given Îľ > 0 there exist Î´(Îľ) > 0 and another
constant Î´1 (independent of Îľ) such that the trajectory of a
solution to the closed-loop Eqs. (26) and (28) under four
algebraic constraints (5) and (7) starting from an arbitrary
given initial state lying on N10 (Î´(Îľ)) âŠ N 18 (Î´1 ) remains on
N10 (Îľ)âŠN 18 (Î´0 ), then the steady state (x0 , 0) is called stable
on a manifold (see Fig. 8).
7.2. Asymptotic stability on a manifold
If there exists a neighborhood N10 (Îľ1 ) of (x0 , 0) on M10
with a certain number Îľ1 > 0 and another neighborhood
N 18 (Î´1 ) in R18 with a certain number Î´1 > 0 such that
the trajectory of a solution to the closed-loop Eqs. (26) and
(28) under the algebraic constraints (5) and (7) starting from
any initial state (x(0), xĚ(0)) lying on N10 (Îľ1 ) âŠ N 18 (Î´1 )
remains in N 18 (Î´0 ) in R18 and converges asymptotically

83

to the lower dimensional manifold M4 âŠ N 18 (Î´0 ), that is,
-fi â 0, -Îťi â 0, Y1 â Y2 = 0, and xĚ â 0 as t â
â, then the steady state (x0 , 0) is said to be asymptotically
stable on a manifold.
Note that, differently from the definition of stability and
asymptotic stability in the conventional theory of Lyapunov
stability of motion, the asymptotic stability on a manifold
need not premise the stability on a manifold, since the former requires only the asymptotic convergence of a solution
trajectory starting from an arbitrarily given initial state in
a neighborhood of the steady state to a steady state on M4
that is lying in N 18 (Î´0 ).
The radius Î´0 for defining neighborhoods N 18 (Î´0 ) must
be taken as a reasonable scale so that, in N 18 (Î´0 ), all four

are independent to each other. It should be remarked that,
in the definition of stability on a manifold, the neighborhood N 18 (Î´0 ) is fixed independently from arbitrarily given
number Îľ > 0. The reason is that it is not necessary to care
how the overall position variables can move as long as the
magnitudes of variables Y1 â Y2 and -Î¸ remain small relative to arbitrarily given Îľ > 0 and the Jacobian matrix J of
algebraic constraints with respect to position state variables
remain to be of full rank (non-degenerated).
In the case of closed-loop dynamics of Eqs. (26) and (28)
when the control signal of intelligence level 1 defined in
Eq. (24) is employed, it is possible to prove both the stability
and the asymptotic stability on a manifold simultaneously
(Arimoto et al., 2003). In the case of closed-loop dynamics
when the control signals of intelligence level 2 defined in
Eq. (44) is employed, it is possible to prove only the asymptotic stability on a manifold (Arimoto, 2003).

8. Sensoryâmotor coordination and learning
Analysis of sensory feedback control for grasping and manipulation of an object by multi-fingered robot hands suggests some possible hypotheses concerning human abilities
of motion learning, as illustrated in the following list.

Fig. 8. Stable grasp in a dynamic sense can be interpreted as a motion
trajectory starting from an initial state on a constrained manifold M10
and converging asymptotically to a lower-dimensional manifold.

(1) Sensoryâmotor coordination can be realized by means of
a linear sum of signals generated from memory sources
of Jacobian vectors (in the motor cortex) being modified with sensed physical variables. Learning of motion
must be rather based on randomly searching for an adequate code that can select a combination of Jacobian

vectors weighted by sensed physical values. Hence, âreinforcement learningâ does not seem dominant in skill
acquirement of human hand motions.
Force feedback based on current measurement data from
force and/or tactile sensors for measuring reaction forces
to both normal and tangential contact forces at finger
surfaces is basically unnecessary for realization of only
secure grasping. Rather, force and tactile sensings are indispensable for constructing a kind of huge data base in
the central nervous system originally acquired through
repeated interactions of fingers with objects in environment and gradually structured as a long-term memory.
From this observation it is possible to infer that human
does not need a digital computer to learn motions that
fulfill everyday tasks but a ubiquitous memory.
There does not arise any need of construction of âinverse
dynamicsâ or âinverse modelâ in the brain to learn a
specified task. Though human limbs like fingers and
arms have a redundant number of degrees of freedom
relative to a minimum number of physical variables for
description of a specified motion, it is unnecessary to
resolve the ill-posedness problem associated with the
inverse kinematics from the specified task space to the
redundant joint space. This observation must be quite
surprising in contrast with the traditional methods of
resolution of the ill-posedness of inverse kinematics,
most of which determine the inverse in joint space by
optimizing an artificially introduced performance index
(Hollerbach & Suh, 1987; Lenarcic, 1991; Scianicco &
Sicilliano, 1996; Vukobratovic & Kircanski, 1986).
The problem of ill-posedness of inverse kinematics
for movement of human limbs with redundant joints
and muscles was first pointed out by N. Bernstein (see
Whiting, 1984), a Russian physiologist. By quoting
Hintonâs paper (Hinton, 1984), Murray et al. said in
their book Murray et al. (1994) that âThe study of
human biological motor mechanisms led the Russian
psychologist Bernstein to question how the brain could
control a system with so many different degrees of freedom interacting in such a complex fashionâ and âMany
of these same complexities are also present in robotic
systems and limit our ability to use multi-fingered hands
and other robotic systems to their full advantageâ. Even
in the year of 2003, the Bernstein problem remains unsolved not only from the control-theoretic viewpoint but
also from the physiological standpoint. However, the
proposed approach described above for intelligent control of multi-fingered hands may contribute somewhat
to unveil the secret of human body motion.
In practice, tuning of feedback gains appearing in feedback signals of Eq. (33) is quite important. In particular, adequate choices for damping coefficients ci (i =
1, 2) and the magnitude of object pressing force fd are
crucial. In order to prevent from occurrence of slippings of finger-ends on the object surfaces, the pressing force fd must be determined in relation to a guess

of the object mass MĚ. Then, ci can be determined by
ci /2fd (r1 + r2 ) = 0.1 âź 0.3, which yields a good performance of transient response of Y1 â Y2 as shown in
the paper (Bae, Tahara, Nakamura, & Arimoto, 2003).
This method is suggested by Hillâs model obtained experimentally in muscle physiology as the force/velocity
characteristics of muscular contraction and relaxation
(Stark, 1968). In relation to this method, experimental results are also shown in (Nakamura, Tahara, Bae,
Sekimoto, & Arimoto, 2003).

9. Conclusions
There remains a lot of problems unsolved regarding intelligent control of multi-fingered hands. Most of discussions
given in the paper should be extended to the case of handling 3D objects. There must exist a class of more simplified
sensory feedback signals of intelligence level 1 or 2 which
are in effect for handling 2D or 3D objects without using
object kinematics and location of the mass center.

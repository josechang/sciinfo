Abstract
This paper is concerned with intelligent control for grasping and manipulation of an object by multi-fingered robot hands with rigid or
soft hemispheric finger ends that induce rolling contacts with the object. Even in the case of 2D motion like pinching by means of a pair of
multi-degrees of freedom robot fingers, there arises an interesting family of Lagrangeâs equations of motion with many geometric constraints,
which are under-actuated, redundant, and non-holonomic in some sense. Regardless of underactuation of dynamics, it is possible to find a class
of sensory feedback signals that realize secure grasp of an object together with control of object orientation. In regard to the secure grasping,
a problem of force/torque closure for 2D objects in a dynamic sense plays a crucial role. It is shown that proposed sensory feedback signals
satisfying the dynamic force/torque closure can be constructed without knowing object kinematic parameters and location of the mass center.
To prove the convergence of motion of the overall fingersâobject system under the circumstance of redundancy of joints, new concepts called
âstability on a manifoldâ and âasymptotic stability on a manifoldâ are introduced. Based on the results found for intelligent control of robotic
hands, the last two sections attempt to discuss why human multi-fingered hands can become so dexterous at grasping and object manipulation.

ABSTRACT
The paper deals with the relations between a priori identifiability and other structural
properties and with identifiability conditions for compartmental systems. Reference is
made to the notions of fixed structure system and of structural property. Structural
controllability and observability and input and output connectability of compartmental
systems are defined, and their relation discussed. Formal definitions are given for
structural identifiability and unique structural identifiability. A newly formulated set of
conditions for structural identifiability of compartmental systems is given that can be
tested in an easy way directly on the compartmental diagram. Some observations reported
in recent literature are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Identifiability
of biological compartmental
systems has recently received
much attention.
Identifiability
deals with the problem of determining
a
priori
whether a planned input-output
identification
experiment is able to
supply the desired information
about the unknown
parameters
of the
compartmental
system; such a problem is to be faced on the basis of the
chosen compartmental
structure and of the planned input-output
experiment. The literature on the matter presents many recent results, particularly
on the class of linear time invariant compartmental
systems (e.g. [l-11]).
In the analysis of structural identifiability
and other related properties
(e.g. structural controllability
and observability) 1different/definitions

been implicitly referred to and some misunderstandings
have arisen about
the validity of suggested identifiability
conditions.
In this paper we analyze the relations between apriori identifiability and
other structural properties and present a newly formulated set of necessary
conditions for structural identifiability of compartmental
systems. In particular, use is made of the notions of fixed structure system and of structural
property (Sec. 2). For the case of compartmental
systems structural controllability and observability, input and output connectability,
and their interrelations are considered (Sec. 3). Formal definitions are given for structural
identifiability
and unique structural identifiability
(Sec. 4). The relations
among the above structural properties are clearly outlined (Sec. 5). Newly
formulated
conditions
for identifiability
of compartmental
systems are
given; the first condition is proved via a heuristic procedure which is valid
also for time varying and/or nonlinear compartmental
systems. The proposed identifiability
test may be performed in an easy way directly on the
compartmental
diagram (Sec. 6). Finally, some observations
reported in
recent literature are discussed by referring to notions and definitions ,of
Sets. 2-6.

and n, and n, are the numbers

systems, a physiologically based structure of the
model is chosen a priori by stating explicitly which of the k,‘s are assumed
to be different from zero; moreover, the design of the experiment defines
the input-output
configuration
by stating the coefficients b,, and c,,,; which
are different from zero. The equations (2) correspond to a particular case of

DEFINITION

By gener-

I

A system is said to be a fixed structure system if the identically null
parameters of a suitable analytical description of it are stated a priori, while
other parameters are free and mutually independent.
For a fixed structure system, the free parameters may be ordered in a
parametrization vector, whose value corresponds to a point in the parameter
space P and characterizes a particular model among all other ones having
the same structure.
DEFINITION

2

A property of a fixed structure system is said to be a structural property if
it holds almost everywhere in the parameter space P.
As a consequence, all information concerning structural properties may
be derived from a graphical representation of the system, as for instance the
compartmental
diagram associated with the equations (2) or in general the
signal flow graph associated with the equations (3).
In the compartmental
case, the parametrization
vector is formed by the
non a priori null coefficients kg, bir, c,,,:, which are actually independent of
each other. If compartmental
equations are rearranged in the general form
(3) the coefficients ag are not mutually independent,
as they are related to

STRUCTURAL
CONTROLLABILITY
AND OBSERVABILITY,
INPUT AND OUTPUT CONNECTABILITY,
AND THEIR
RELATIONS.

In the framework of system theory a very important role is played by the
properties of controllability and observability. In order to give intuitive
insight into such properties, controllability
may be considered as the possibility of influencing
each state variable independently
by means of the
control inputs, and observability
may be considered as the possibility of
reconstructing
each state variable from the knowledge of the outputs.
Two important structural properties are related to controllability
and
observability: structural controllability and structural observability [ 13, 141. A
fixed structure system is said to be structurally controllable
(structurally
observable)
if it is controllable
(observable)
almost everywhere in the
parameter space.
Other interesting structural properties have been recently defined in [ 151,
i.e., input and output connectability. With reference to a graphical representation of the analytical description of the system [for instance the compartmental diagram for Eq. (2) or in general a signal flow graph for Eq. (3)], a
state variable is said to be input (output) connectable if there exists a path
from an input to the considered state (from the considered state to an
output). A fixed structure system is said to be input (output) connectable if
all its state variables are input (output) connectable.
The corresponding
notions for nonlinear systems have been defined in [16] as input (output)
reachability.
From an intuitive point of view, the difference between structural controllability and input connectability
lies in the fact that in the second case,
state variables are influenced by the inputs but not necessarily in independent ways. Similarly, output connectability
assures the influence of each
state variable on at least one output, but does not assure the possibility of
reconstructing
the individual value of each state variable from the knowledge of the outputs as in the case of structural observability. The relations
between structural controllability
(observability)
and input (output) connectability may be put in a formal way by means of the following theorem
given in [15].
THEOREM

A fixed structure system is structurally controllable (observable) if and on&
if the following conditions both hold:
(i) the Jystem is input (output) connectable,
(ii) rank( A j B ) = n (rank -s- = n),

FIG. 1. Example of an input connectable but not structurally controllable compartmental system.

Clearly input (output) connectability
is a necessary but not sufficient
condition for structural controllability
(observability). As an example let US
consider the compartmental
system of Fig. 1. Compartments
2 and 3 form a
closed subsystem, as there is no outflow from it; it is evident that it is
impossible to influence in an independent way the compartmental
quantity
4 and the sum of the compartmental
quantities 2 and 3, by means of the
input in compartment
1. Formally, if condition (ii) is tested, we have
rank( A / B ) ~4, as uz2= - u32 and uJ3= - uz3 [see Eq. (4)]. For compartmental systems, the general case of not structurally controllable but input
connectable systems corresponds to a situation where a single compartment
(or a single input) feeds more than one closed subsystem.
An example of output connectable but not structurally observable compartmental
system is given in Fig. 2. The general case corresponds to a
situation where a single measurement is taken on compartments
belonging
to more than one closed subsystem.

STRUCTURAL

IDENTIFIABILITY

Structural identifiability is another structural property. As is well known,
the analysis of structural identifiability
allows us to test upriori whether all
the unknown parameters of the system considered can be estimated via the
planned input-output
experiment. In order to rigorously define structural

identifiability
we will now formalize some preliminary concepts (see also
[6]) by using the notion of output distinguishability
[17].
Given a fixed structure system, two parametrization
vectors p’ and p” in
P are said to be (output) indistinguishable if the outputs of the corresponding systems y(p’) and y(p”) are identical for every input u and every initial
state x,, = x(0). Otherwise the two parametrization
vectors are said to be
(output) distinguishable.
A fixed structure system is said to be locally identifiable in p’ if there
exists a neighborhood e(p’) such that, for everyp” +p’ in it, the pair (p’,p”)
is distinguishable;
it is said to be globally identifiabIe in p’ if, for every
p”#p’ in the whole space P, the pair (p’,p”) is distinguishable.
A fixed
structure system is said to be almost everywhere locally (globally) identifiable
if it is locally (globally) identifiable in every p’ of the space P, except at
most in a subspace of zero measure (that is excepting) at most a line in a
bidimensional
parameter space, at most a surface in tridimensional
space,
etc.).
With reference to the problem of structural identifiability
of compartmental systems, on the basis of the above concepts we are now able to state
the following definitions:

IDENTIFIABILITY

In some previous papers [2-51, the authors gave conditions for structural
identifiability
of linear, time invariant compartmental
systems (in the sense
of Definition 3). The first of the given conditions required a property which
is actually identical to input and output connectability;
however, as the
above papers were written before the introduction
of this notion, the
original formulation of the identifiability
criterion was referred to structural
controllability
and observability and to an “extension” of them. As the use
of input and output connectability
shows many advantages (in particular, it
may be tested directly on the compartmental
diagram without making use
of more complex notions derived from system theory), here we will express
the first structural identifiability
condition in terms of input and output
connectability
and give a new heuristic proof of it.

Each subsystem may be formed by more than one compartment,
and
therefore each directed arc in Fig. 3(a) represents the whole set of nonzero
transport rate constants connecting compartments
of a subsystem to compartments of another subsystem or to the environment.
Similarly the set of
perturbation
inputs and the set of measurement outputs are represented by
a single arrow for each subsystem.
The input-output relation of the system of Fig. 3(a) remains unchanged if
we eliminate the compartments not belonging to the i.c. and O.C. subsystem
together with the transport rate constants outgoing from them [Fig. 3(b)]. In
fact, taking into account the equations (2), it is easy to realize that any
variation in the measured outputs is determined only by a variation of
output connectable compartments,
while a variation in any compartmental
quantity may be induced by perturbation
inputs only if the corresponding
compartment
is input connectable.
As a consequence,
the transport rate
parameters we have thus eliminated
cannot appear in the input-output
relations, and therefore they cannot be estimated via the designed experiment. Thus the above theorem is proved.
It may be remarked that for a strongly connected compartmental
system
[2, 191 the above necessary conditions hold for any planned experimental

The extension of the above Theorem 2 is straightforward. Let us consider
the case where some parameters kij of the equations (2) are not constant but
are functions of time (time varying compartmental systems) and/or of the
quantities associated to the compartments
(nonlinear compartmental TSterns). It is easy to recognize that the above theorem holds in this case too:
in fact, the analytical expressions for those parameters that correspond to
graph arcs outgoing from non-input- and/or non-output-connectable
compartments do not affect any input-output
relation.
As far as relations between structural identifiability
and structural controllability and observability are concerned, two simple examples will show
that the latter are not necessary conditions for structural identifiability.
Let us first consider the system of Fig. 5, where the input and output
coefficients b, ,, ci2, and cz3 are assumed to be known. The system is input
and output connectable
but not structurally
controllable
(see Sec. 3);
however it is structurally identifiable, as can be easily seen by the analysis
of the transfer matrix G(s). In fact the numerators allow the estimation of
k,, and k,, respectively, while k,, can be estimated from the denominator.
A similar example is shown in Fig. 6, where the input and output
coefficients b, ,, ciz, and cl3 (ci2#c,J
are assumed to be known. The system
is input and output connectable, not structurally observable (see Sec. 3), but

Table 1 (compartments
3, 4, 5 form a cascade part which is common to
subsystems 11, 12, 21). Therefore, n, = 15. If input and output matrices B
and C are assumed to be known, then n, = 17 and condition (5) is not
satisfied; therefore, the designed experiment does not allow the identification of the considered system.
Condition (5) is based on the following considerations.
The information
that can be achieved from the experiment on the system is contained in the
transfer matrix, i.e., in the nsnc transfer functions relating each input to an
output. The coefficients of numerator and denominator polynomials of the
transfer functions depend on the unknown parameters of the system and
supply a certain number of (nonlinear) relations among them. These relations are in general not independent
on each other; therefore, the problem
has to be faced of determining
the number of independent
equations in
order to compare it with the number n, of unknowns.
The number n, of condition (5) is a number of equations obtained after
having removed certain dependencies.
In particular, the following causes of dependency are taken into account:
all transfer functions in the nonreduced
form have the same denominator, i.e., the n degree polynomial det(sZ-A)
some coefficients are a pviori null, and therefore, supply no information; this can happen for the n’ lower degree coefficients of the
denominator
polynomial
and for the higher degree coefficients of
some numerators
common factors may exist between numerator
and denominator
(when some compartments
are not connectable to the input or to the
output of the considered transfer function)
common factors may exist among numerators
of different transfer
functions (when cascade common parts are present).
Dependency
among equations may arise due to other causes. Two
examples are presented in Figs. 9 and 10, where dependency is not due to

Presently, no rules have been worked out to detect directly on the
compartmental
diagram (without writing symbolically
input-output
relations) dependency situations of the type of Figs. 9 and 10. In any case,
input-output
connectability
and condition (5) are very useful in the experiment design: in fact, they can be easily tested on the diagram, thus allowing
us to immediately rule out those experiments which structurally cannot be
successful. They also give us some suggestions on possible modifications,
either on the model or on the input-output
configuration.

DISCUSSION

In this paper, previous results obtained by the authors [2-5, 211 are
updated by proposing a newly stated set of necessary conditions
for
structural identifiability of linear time invariant compartmental
systems (see
also IS]). The conditions are:
(i) the system has to be input and output connectable;
(ii) the number n, of unknown parameters does not exceed the number n,
of equations among them.
Both conditions may be easily tested directly on the compartmental
diagram in a rapid manual way, as seen in the example of Fig. 8; for
complex systems a computer program has been developed for a multiinput-multi output configuration
[22].
Testing input and output connectability
is very easy and a negative
answer of this test avoids a lot of useless analytical computation, while the
diagram structure suggests suitable modifications
of the planned experiment. On the other hand, if one needs the analytical expression of the
transfer function matrix, the analysis of input and output connectability
avoids the computation of the transfer functions in a nonreduced form (i.e.,
with common factors between numerator and denominator).
As an exam-

ple, by looking at Fig. 4 it can be noticed that the minimal form of the
transfer function is the one corresponding to the system of Fig. 4(b) which
requires an inversion of a matrix of dimension two; if, on the contrary, the
system of Fig. 4(a) is considered, an inversion of a matrix of order six is
required to obtain the same transfer function in nonreduced form. Conditions (i) and (ii) refer to identifiability as defined in Sec. 4, i.e., to (local or
global) identifiability almost everywhere in the parameter space (which
includes the possibly a priori known input or output parameters). Therefore
there may exist a zero measure subspace of the parameter space where the
system having the considered structure (elsewhere identifiable) is not
identifiable. A typical case is the one of Fig. 6: if c,* and cl3 are a priori
assumed to be equal; in this case numerator and denominator supply
nonindependent relations between the unknown parameters kZ, and k3,. If,
on the contrary, they are different, no dependence between the equations
occurs. In the parameter space (k,,, k31,c,2,c,3), the points where c,~= c,a
form a zero measure set. The considered example is a particular case of the
situation where an output measurement is the equally weighted sum of all
compartments of a closed subsystem.
While, in the above example, the critical situation may be easily detected
a priori by looking at the compartmental diagram and output configuration,
other critical cases of similar type may be detected a priori only by
evaluating the rank of the Jacobian of the Markov parameters [ 171.
The above comments allow us to clarify some misunderstandings recently reported in [8, 10, 111.
In [8], Di Stefano made some comments on the relationships between
structural identifiability and controllability and observability properties.
Such relationships were discussed in [21] and have been clearly analyzed in
Sets. 4, 5 by resorting also to the properties of input and output connectability. It is to be noted however that Di Stefano presents an example which
is to be considered a case of a constrained identification experiment as the
system is made up of two isolated one-parameter subsystems, one of which
is neither input nor output connectable but is assumed a priori to be equal
to the other.
In [ 10, 111, Delforge made some comments about our previous work. His
considerations of comment 3 of [lo] and comment 2 of [ 1 l] refer to unique
structural identifiability (see our definition 4 of Sec. 4). In comment 1 of
[lo] Delforge asserts that even if the number n, of equations is less than the
number n,, of unknown parameters a solution is possible if exact relations
exist among the parameters. Obviously, giving exact relations among
parameters is equivalent to adding an independent equation to the ones
obtained by the transfer function matrix. Comment 2 of [lo] and comment
1 of [ 1 l] state that the condition n, = n, assures a finite number of solutions
only if the equations are independent. This is correct, as stated also in Sec. 6

with reference to the systems of Figs. 9 and 10. However one example is
reported by Delforge in [ 10, 1 l] on this matter which is not relevant as
dependence
between two equations is due to a particular value of the
elements of output matrix C, i.e. cl1 = cl2 as in the case of Fig. 6. The system
with the given structure is identifiable almost everywhere in the parameter
space but it is not identifiable for the particular values of output coefficients
considered by Delforge. This type of nonidentifiability
in a zero measure
region of the parameter space is already taken into account by Definition 3.

CONCLUSIONS

In this paper structural identifiability
of linear time invariant compartmental systems and related structural properties have been investigated.
Structural controllability
and observability
as well as input and output
connectability
of compartmental
systems have been considered by themselves and in their relations. Relevance of these properties with respect to
structural identifiability
is discussed; in particular input and output connectability is proved to be a necessary condition for structural identifiability
(also valid for time variant and/or nonlinear systems). A newly formulated
set of necessary identifiability
conditions is presented which can be applied
easily and directly from the knowledge of the compartmental
structure and
of the designed experiment (without computing the symbolic expression of
the transfer function matrix). Some observations reported in recent literature have been discussed.

This paper presents a coupled and directly self-adaptive underactuated (CDSA) grasp mode,
which has hybrid functions: coupled grasp and directly self-adaptive grasp. A novel multipulley-belt ¯nger mechanism with springs is designed based on CDSA grasp mode. Compared
with traditional coupled underactuated ¯ngers or directly self-adaptive underactuated ¯ngers,
the grasp process of the new ¯nger is more humanoid and its stability is better. Force analysis
and size optimization rules of the ¯nger are given. A multi-¯ngered robotic hand, CDSA hand,
based on the CDSA ¯nger is developed, whose control system adopts a digital signal processor
(DSP) circuit module with a keyboard as its communication interface. The CDSA hand has ¯ve
¯ngers, six DC motors, and 15 joint DOF, nine of which are CDSA joint DOF. The appearance
and actions of CDSA hand imitate human hand, whose size is 1.5 times of human hand. CDSA
hand weighs 1.6 kg and can grasp objects up to 0.5 kg. Simulation and experimental results show
that CDSA hand is able to realize CDSA grasp mode e®ectively.
Keywords: Multi-¯ngered robotic hand; grasp mode; underactuated grasp; coupled ¯nger; selfadaptive ¯nger.

1. Introduction
Various kinds of robots have been widely used in the industrial processes. Service
robots1,2 are being developed for the handicapped and medical applications. To carry
out a variety of service activities, a robot needs at least one hand that can grasp and
manipulate various objects.3 Humanoid robotic hands become focus of intelligent
robot research for some characteristics of it, like many degrees of freedom (DOF),
small volume, powerful output and complex control. For these and other reasons, the
study of multi-¯ngered robot hands has greatly interested the research community
since the early days of robotics.

Over the past three decades, research on dexterous hand has gained lot of
achievements. Generally speaking, a dexterous hands has 3  5 robot ¯ngers with
2  4 DOF each ¯nger, whose joints are mostly driven by actuators actively.
Examples of dexterous hands include Stanford/JPL Hand,4 Utah/MIT Hand,5 DLR
series hands,6,7 Robonaut Hand,8 Shadow series hands, UB hands,9 BH series hands
by Beihang University and DLR/HIT series hands1012 by Harbin Institute of
Technology. Dexterous hands highly depend on the sensors, algorithms and
control systems. The complexity of dexterous hands makes them high cost and low
reliability.
Underactuated robot hands can overcome some drawbacks of dexterous hands. In
recent 10 years, they become more and more important in the ¯eld of robot hand
research.
Generally speaking, an underactuated robot hand consists of a palm and several
underactuated ¯ngers. The number of actuators of an underactuated ¯nger is less
than its DOF.
On the basis of grasp mode of traditional underactuated ¯ngers, they could be
classi¯ed into two kinds: coupled underactuated ¯ngers and directly self-adaptive
underactuated ¯ngers.
Take a two-joint coupled ¯nger as an example to explain the action process of them.
If the ¯rst joint rotates, the second joint will rotate by an angle with a ¯xed proportion
to the rotational angle of the ¯rst joint. The rotational proportion of the ¯rst joint and
the second joint is determined by the coupled mechanisms. Typical coupled hands
include Southampton Hand,13 MANUS-Hand,14 TBM Hand15 and SDM Hand.1618
The adaptation is designed as a main function of directly self-adaptive underactuated ¯ngers. This kind of robot ¯ngers can self-adapt to di®erent sizes and
shapes of objects. Typical self-adaptive underactuated hands include SARAH
Hand,19 underactuated hands designed by HIT, LARM Hand,20 underactuated
hands designed by BH University,21 TH-3R Hand22 and GCUA Hand.23
Brie°y, the grasp ability of directly self-adaptive underactuated hands is better
than coupled underactuated hands while the grasp motion of coupled underactuated
hands is more similar to human hands.
This paper studies on underactuated grasp mode under unstructured environment and low cost underactuated robotic hands.
2. Principle of CDSA Function
In this section, the traditional underactuated ¯ngers' features will be discussed ¯rst.
Then, a coupled and directly self-adaptive underactuated (CDSA) grasp mode is
presented. The relationship of coupled and self-adaptive underactuated (COSA)
grasp mode, CDSA grasp mode, coupled and indirectly self-adaptive underactuated
(CISA) grasp mode is introduced next. Fourth, a CDSA mechanism is designed to
realize the CDSA grasp mode. At the end of this section, force analysis and size
optimization rules of the CDSA mechanism are given.

2.1. The characteristics of traditional underactuated grasp modes
During the grasp process of a coupled ¯nger, all joints of it rotate at the same time.
The grasp motion of coupled ¯ngers is closely similar to human ¯ngers. In addition,
coupled ¯ngers are good at grasping objects with pinch motion.
However, coupled underactuated ¯ngers cannot self-adapt to di®erent sizes and
shapes of objects, while they cannot closely wrap objects. The upper phalanges may
not touch the objects when the lower phalanges are blocked by the objects, which are
shown in Fig. 1. Thus, this type of hands is not a good universal gripper.
Directly self-adaptive underactuated ¯ngers can adjust their motion to the
di®erent sizes and shapes of objects. This kind of ¯ngers has a good adaptability. The
self-adaption is the main virtue of them. Compared with coupled underactuated
¯ngers, the grasp ability of directly self-adaptive underactuated ¯ngers is improved.
But directly self-adaptive underactuated ¯ngers cannot bend the middle joints
before contacting the grasped objects, which limits its appearance during grasping
objects and ability to grasp small objects. The grasp process of directly self-adaptive
underactuated ¯ngers is shown in the Fig. 2.
2.2. CDSA grasp mode
Aiming to overcome the shortcomings and combining the merits of traditional
underactuated hands, this paper presents a CDSA grasp mode.

Underactuated grasp process of the CDSA ¯nger.

The CDSA grasp mode includes two stages: coupled grasp and directly selfadaptive grasp. It means that the joints of robot ¯nger rotate at the same time when
the ¯nger approaches the objects gradually, which makes the motion of ¯nger very
human-like. After the robot ¯nger touches objects, it can self-adapt to di®erent
objects, which improves the ¯nger's adaptability.
Therefore, the robot ¯ngers with CDSA grasp mode have self-adaption and
coupled function. Their grasp ability and motion appearance are better than traditional underactuated ¯ngers. CDSA robot ¯ngers represent a new path for innovation in robotic ¯nger design. Figure 3 is the grasp process of CDSA mode.
2.3. The relationship of COSA, CDSA, CISA
Aiming to overcome some drawbacks of traditional underactuated grasp mode,
COSA grasp mode, CDSA grasp mode and CISA grasp mode are proposed. Figure 4
shows the relationship among them.
Based on the di®erences of self-adaption grasp process, the COSA grasp mode
could be classi¯ed to CISA grasp mode and CDSA grasp mode. For example, a twojoint ¯nger of CISA grasp mode has one receiver in the ¯rst phalanx. Before the
receiver touches objects, ¯nger moves with coupled grasp mode. As soon as the ¯rst
phalanx is blocked by objects, receiver will drive the second phalanx rotate. It is a
kind of indirect self-adaption, because there must be receivers in the CISA ¯ngers.
Compared with CISA ¯ngers, two-joint CDSA ¯ngers do not need receivers in
them. As soon as the ¯rst phalanx is blocked by objects, the two-joint CDSA ¯nger
can self-adapt to the shapes of objects without receivers. CDSA grasp mode has
direct self-adaption.
2.4. CDSA mechanism
The components of the CDSA mechanism are shown in Fig. 5.
The motor is ¯xed in the base. The ¯rst shaft is located within the base and
revolves both within the base and the lower part of the ¯rst phalanx; the second shaft
is located further from the base and revolves within the upper part of the ¯rst
phalanx and the second phalanx.

The ¯xed pulley envelops the ¯rst shaft and is ¯xed to the base; the ¯rst passive
pulley envelops the second shaft and is ¯xed to it; the ¯rst belt connects the ¯xed
pulley and the ¯rst passive pulley. These are the main components of the coupled
mechanism.
The second active pulley envelops the ¯rst shaft and is ¯xed to it; the second
passive pulley envelops the second shaft and is ¯xed to it; the second belt connects
the second active pulley and the second passive pulley. These are the main components of directly self-adaptive mechanism.
Besides pulley-belt mechanism, linkage mechanism, gear mechanism, gear-rack
mechanism, sprocket-chain mechanism and tendon mechanism also can be applied to
make up coupled mechanism and directly self-adaptive mechanism.
In addition, the ¯rst spring connects the ¯rst shaft and the ¯rst phalanx; the
second spring connects the second shaft and the ¯rst passive pulley; the third spring
connects the second shaft and the second passive pulley.
Here is the working process of CDSA mechanism. This paper supposes that the
second spring and the third spring have the same elasticity in order to explain the
function process of the CDSA mechanism clearly.
When the motor starts to rotate, it will drive the ¯rst shaft to rotate by an angle
. The ¯rst phalanx rotates by the same angle . The second shaft rotates by the
same angle  as a result of the coupled mechanism functioning. At the same time, the
directly self-adaptive mechanism keeps the second phalanx static relative to the ¯rst
phalanx. There is a con°ict here. For the existence of the springs between the two
mechanisms, the ¯nal e®ect is that the second shaft rotates by the angle of /2. The
second and the third springs deform both. The ¯rst phalanx cannot rotate until the
¯nger is in contact with the object. The motor continues rotating and drives the ¯rst
shaft to rotate. Under the action of the ¯rst spring, the ¯rst phalanx will wrap around
an object more and more tightly. The coupled mechanism cannot work any longer
while the directly self-adaptive mechanism can keep on working. The second active
pulley drags the second passive pulley through the second belt. The second passive
pulley is connected with the second shaft by the third spring. The deformation of the
third spring gradually becomes smaller and will ultimately be opposite to its original
deformation. In this process, because the second spring keeps on deforming, the
coupled mechanism will not block rotation of the second shaft. The second phalanx,
¯xed with the second shaft, rotates until it also touches the object. At this time, the
CDSA ¯nger completes the grasp task.
2.5. Force analysis of CDSA mechanism
The grasp process of CDSA mechanism consists of coupled grasp and directly
self-adaptive grasp. The following force analyses are based on these two modes.
Figure 6(a) shows the static force analysis of coupled grasp mode. Figure 6(b) shows
the force analysis of directly self-adaptive grasp mode. O1 O2 stands for the ¯rst
phalanx, O2 B stands for the second phalanx. O1 and O2 are the centers of the ¯rst

(ii) For 1 and 2 of any value, f1 and f2 will always remain positive and the values of
them will be su±ciently large for the ¯ngers to e®ectively grasp objects stably.
These simulation results show that the CDSA ¯nger is e®ective: it can grasp objects
stably.

2.6. Elasticity of springs
The second spring and the third spring coordinate the movements of coupled
mechanism and directly self-adaptive mechanism when the CDSA mechanism works.
Springs are key components of CDSA mechanism. The elasticity of springs applied in
¯ngers will a®ect the stability of CDSA mechanism and even the grasp ability of
CDSA ¯ngers. The selecting of springs is an important step during design of ¯ngers.
Depending on the above analysis, the relationship is arrived at:

When TM ¼ 300 Nmm, r1 ¼ r2 ¼ r3 ¼ r4 , 1 is 45  , the range of 2 is 0  90  , the
range of K2 and K3 are 0  10 Nmm/rad, h 2 ¼ 30 mm, l 2 ¼ 60 mm, then the
relationships of K2 , 2 and f2 are shown in Fig. 8(a) and the relationships of K3 , 2
and f2 in Fig. 8(b).
In Fig. 7(a), when value of 2 has been identi¯ed, softer the second spring gets
more powerful f2 . Compared with values of f2 , when value of 2 has been identi¯ed,
tougher the third spring gets the more powerful f2 , which is shown in Fig. 7(b). It
means the third spring should be tougher than the second spring. Considering the
working process of a two-joint CDSA ¯nger to understand these analysis results,
the second spring makes the coupled mechanism work and the third spring makes
the directly self-adaptive mechanism work. After the ¯rst phalanx touches objects
while the second phalanx does not touch objects, the second spring makes the second
phalanx rotate forward but the third spring makes the second phalanx rotate
backward. At the end of the two-joint CDSA ¯nger's grasp process, the deformations
of second spring and third spring are opposite with each other. So the third spring
should be tougher than the second spring for better grasp stability.

grasp mode and multi-pulley-belt mechanism.
3.1. Structural design of the two-joint finger
The components of the two-joint CDSA ¯nger are shown in Fig. 9. This ¯nger has
one embedded motor to drive two joints of it. There is only one CDSA mechanism in
it. In addition, the output shaft of motor is ¯xed with the ¯rst bevel gear, which is
meshing with the second bevel gear. The second bevel gear is ¯xed with the ¯rst

shaft. Modules of ¯rst bevel gear and second bevel gear are 1while number of teeth of
them is 16. The two-joint CDSA ¯nger has two DOF, one of which is CDSA joint
DOF. It is 1.5 times the size of human hand's thumb, with ¯nger length of 89 mm,
¯nger width of 22 mm, ¯nger thickness of 20 mm and rotation angle range of 0   90 
for all joints.
3.2. Structural design of the three-joint finger
Design of the three-joint CDSA ¯nger is shown in Fig. 10. The three-joint CDSA
¯nger has the same design principle like two-joint CDSA ¯nger. This ¯nger has one
embedded motor to drive three joints of it. There are two CDSA mechanisms in it.
The four three-joint ¯ngers of CDSA hand have the same structure at di®erent sizes.
The three-joint CDSA ¯nger has three DOF, two of which are CDSA joint DOF. The
middle ¯nger is 1.5 times the size of human hand's middle ¯nger, with ¯nger length of
132 mm, ¯nger width of 22 mm, ¯nger thickness of 20 mm and rotation angle range of
0   90  for all joints. Every ¯nger of CDSA hand can grasp objects independently
with CDSA grasp mode.

3.3. Freedom planning and modular design of CDSA hand
The CDSA hand has ¯ve ¯ngers and 15 joint DOF (six active joint DOF, nine CDSA
joint DOF), which is shown in Fig. 11. In Fig. 11(a), dark cylinders stand for active
joint DOF and light-colored cylinders stand for CDSA joint DOF. Figure 11(b) is the
motor distribution inside the CDSA hand.
In Fig. 12(a), module A is the CDSA module. Module B is the active foot joint of
¯ve ¯ngers with one embedded actuator, reducer and gear transmission. Module C is
the swing joint of the thumb in which there is one embedded actuator. Figure 12(b) is
the outward appearance of CDSA hand.
The four three-joint ¯ngers have the same structure at di®erent sizes, with one
motor driving three joints. The palm has one motor driving the lateral swing of the
base of the thumb, while the thumb has one motor driving two joints.
CDSA hand is 1.5 times the size of an adult's hand, with length of 250 mm, palm
length of 144 mm, palm width of 106 mm, palm thickness of 45 mm with rotation

human hand. Before ¯ngers are blocked by objects, all the shafts rotate simultaneously. The CDSA hand can self-adapt to di®erent objects.
Figure 14 shows some pictures of the CDSA hand's grasp process. CDSA hand can
self-adapt to objects of di®erent sizes and shapes and can grasp the objects stably.
The experiments prove that the new CDSA grasp mode is e®ective and the CDSA
hand can stably grasp di®erent objects with the CDSA mode. The motion appearance of CDSA hand is highly anthropopathic and the hand can self-adaptively grasp
objects stably.
5. Conclusion
This paper presents a CDSA grasp mode, which can achieve coupled grasp and
directly self-adaptive grasp at the same time.
Based on the CDSA grasp mode, this paper designs a CDSA ¯nger with multi-pulleybelt mechanism and gives the optimization rules and force analysis of CDSA ¯nger.
A multi-¯ngered robotic hand, CDSA hand, based on the CDSA ¯nger is developed, whose control system adopts a digital signal processor (DSP) circuit module
with a keyboard as its communication interface. CDSA hand has ¯ve ¯ngers, 15 joint
DOF (nine of them are CDSA joint DOF). Grasp experimental results show CDSA
hand is able to realize CDSA grasp mode e®ectively and grasps objects stably.

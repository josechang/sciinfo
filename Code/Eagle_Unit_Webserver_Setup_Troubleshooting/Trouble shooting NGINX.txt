Trouble shooting NGINX

When you start nginx using

	$ sudo systemctl start nginx

And you see the error

	“Job for nginx.service failed because the control process exited with error code. See "systemctl status nginx.service" and "journalctl -xe" for details.”

Type in (in the putty command window)

	$ journalctl –xe

If you see the following error (can be seen towards the end of the window and note the date will be your current date)


".........

This means that nginx or some other process is already using port 80. Type-in the following in the putty command window to kill it.

	$ sudo fuser -k 80/tcp

Then restart nginx again, using the previous command:

	$ sudo systemctl start nginx

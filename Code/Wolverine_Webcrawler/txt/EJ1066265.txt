Abstract 

 

 

Do  undergraduates  whose  native  language  is  not  English  have  writing  deficiencies  leading  to 
academic struggles? The present study showed that the answer to this question was “no” at an 
American  West  Coast  public  university.  This  university’s  nonresident  undergraduates  on 
average  earned  B-  to  B+  in  their  colleges’  English  intensive-writing  programs’  classes,  C  in 
community college English classes, and term grade point averages between 2.5 (C+ to B-) and 
3.2  (B)  in  the  fall  term  of  the  five  most  recent  academic  years.  Hierarchical  linear  modeling 
analyses showed that the predictors with the largest effect sizes were English writing programs 
and class level; however, each predictor accounted for less than 25% of the total variance.

How  can  American  universities  maximize  the  academic  success  of  their  nonresident 
undergraduates  whose  native  language  is  not  English?  This  question  has  become  increasingly 
important  in  recent  years  due  to  the  dramatic  increase  in  the  nonimmigrant  international 
undergraduate  population  attending  American  universities  (Institute  for  International  Education 
[IIE],  2013a).  Universities’  admissions  offices  potentially  could  maximize  the  likelihood  that 
admitted applicants will succeed academically by establishing appropriate entrance requirements. 
One  entrance  requirement  that  many  American  universities  have  been  using  to  predict 
applicants’  academic  success  is  the  Test  of  English  as  a  Foreign  Language  (TOEFL). 
Approximately 260 American universities require nonresident applicants whose native language 
is  not  English  to  submit  TOEFL  scores  (American  Exam  Services,  2013);  TOEFL  scores  are 
used as an indicator of English proficiency to predict future academic success (Andrade, 2006). 

If English proficiency is a valid predictor of academic success for nonresident applicants 
who are not native English speakers (Andrade, 2006), then admitted applicants who subsequently

struggle with English—despite having acceptable TOEFL scores—might be expected to struggle 
academically. To the contrary, a recent study (Fass-Holmes & Vaughn, 2014) demonstrated that 
at one American university the majority of nonimmigrant international undergraduates succeeded 
academically  (term  grade  point  averages  [GPA]  above  2.0  [C])  despite  showing  evidence  of 
struggling  with  English.  The  evidence  was  that  a  majority  of  these  students  failed  the 
university’s  mandatory  English  writing  proficiency  exam,  and  they  were  required  to  attend 
community college classes in English Composition and/or English as a Second Language (ESL).  
Nonresident  undergraduates’  English  proficiency  and  academic  success  could  be 
influenced by numerous variables, some of which are student-specific and readily accessible for 
statistical analysis (e.g., students’ citizenship country, class level, etc.), others are school-specific 
(e.g., classes which are taught in a particular academic term versus ones that span across several 
academic  terms,  majors  within  academic  departments,  colleges  within  universities,  etc.),  and 
others are unknown and/or cost-prohibitive to collect (e.g., parents’ English proficiency, parents’ 
highest  level  of  education,  etc.)  (Osborne,  2000;  Raudenbush  &  Bryk,  2002).  Such  variables 
need to be managed properly, and hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) offers many advantages in 
this  regard.  HLM  analyzes  data  that  are  nested  at  multiple  levels,  computes  an  estimation  of 
individual effects, partitions variance across levels, determines how much variance is accounted 
for at individual and group levels (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002), uses full-information maximum 
likelihood estimation to handle missing data (Little & Rubin, 2002) and avoids the need to use 
multiple imputations (Little & Rubin, 2002). This statistical technique is more advantageous than 
ordinary  least  squares  (OLS)  regression,  another  predictive  statistical  technique,  because  OLS 
regression assumes independence of observations; nested data rarely fulfill this key assumption 
(Ker,  2014;  Raudenbush  &  Bryk,  2002).  Consequently,  OLS  regression  tends  to  underestimate 
level 2 effects (in the present study, individual level) whereas HLM does not (Osborne, 2000). 

HLM analyses previously have shown that country of origin and major department were 
significant predictor variables for term GPAs of the aforementioned international undergraduates 
who  succeeded  academically  despite  failing  an  English  proficiency  exam  (Fass-Holmes  & 
Vaughn,  2014).  Each  of  these  variables  accounted  for  less  than  5%  of  the  total  variance—
“small”  effect  sizes  (Cohen,  1988;  Raudenbush  &  Bryk,  2002),  indicating  that  they  did  not 
explain the students’ academic success in spite of English struggles. The present study took the 
opposite  approach  by  using  an  indicator  of  English  struggles  (academic  marks  in  required 
English  intensive-writing  classes)  instead  of  an  indicator  of  academic  success  (term  GPAs)  in 
HLM analyses.   

If  nonresident  undergraduates  with  acceptable  TOEFL  scores  do  have  English 
deficiencies,  they  might  be  expected  to  struggle  in  English  intensive-writing  classes.  This 
hypothesis was tested in the present study. Specifically, this study’s  goals were to evaluate the 
degree to which nonresident undergraduates attending a West Coast public university (hereafter 
referred to  as “University”) struggled in English intensive-writing  classes, and to use HLM for 
identifying what variables predict struggles in these classes. 

The present study’s goals originated from a request by the University’s College Writing 
Programs’  directors  for  a  longitudinal  analysis  of  nonresident  (nonimmigrant  international, 
permanent resident [PR], and undocumented [OT]) undergraduates’ academic performance in the 
programs’  required  English  intensive-writing  classes.  The  issue/concern  which  prompted  the 
request was whether or not these students were progressing satisfactorily through these classes. 
The directors’ concern arose because of a generalization repeated by faculty, administrators, and 
advisors  that  the  University’s  undergraduates  whose  native  language  was  not  English,  as  a

whole,  had  deficient  English  skills  which  were  inadequate  to  meet  the  University’s  academic 
requirements. The University’s academic requirements, beyond the minimum TOEFL score for 
admission (83 or higher on the internet-based version), included the following: 

 
•  Demonstrating  a  minimum  level  of  English  writing  proficiency—The  University’s 
undergraduates (including domestic students) must fulfill this requirement during their freshman 
year by scoring above a specified level on various standardized college entrance exams or on the 
University’s proprietary writing exam, earning at least a C in a transferable college-level English 
composition class, or scoring above a specified level on an advanced placement English exam. 
Any  undergraduate  who  fails  this  requirement  must  attend  a  writing  program  consisting  of 
English  Composition  (EC)  and  ESL  classes,  earn  a  C  or  above,  and  pass  an  exit  exam.  These 
classes are taught on the University’s campus by instructors from a local community college. 

 
• Successfully  complete  College  Writing  Program  classes—After  fulfilling  the  English 
writing  proficiency  requirement,  the  University’s  undergraduates  also  must  take  two  of  the 
College  Writing  Programs’  classes.  Each  student  belongs  to  one  of  the  University’s  colleges, 
each  of  which  has  its  own  unique  writing  program  with  distinctive  number,  content,  and 
sequence of intensive writing classes. This is a graduation-related requirement. 

 

Literature Review 

 
American  universities  have  admitted  an  increasing  number  of  international  undergraduates  in 
recent  years.  According  to  IIE’s  annual  Open  Doors  snapshot  survey  (IIE,  2013a),  the  total 
number  of  international  students  enrolled  in  fall  2013  (FA13)  was  higher  than  in  fall  2012 
(FA12)  at  72%  (274)  of  the  American  universities  that  participated  in  the  survey.  IIE’s  Open 
Doors  report  for  academic  year  (AY)  2012–13  showed  an  increase  in  the  total  number  of 
international students in American higher education. This was the seventh consecutive year that 
the  number  increased.  The  7.2  %  increase  in  new  internationals  who  enrolled  in  AY2012–13 
compared  with  2011–12  was  largely  due  to  Chinese  undergraduates  studying  in  the  United 
States. Enrollment of Chinese undergraduates increased 21% from AY2011–12 to 2012–13 (IIE, 
2013b). 

An  increase  in  the  number  of  international  undergraduates  also  has  occurred  at  the 
University  that  is  the  focus  of  the  present  study  (IIE,  2013a,b).  This  University  is  located  in  a 
large city’s suburbs; it has more than 20,000 undergraduates; it has earned national recognition 
for academic and research excellence (U.S. News and  World Report’s top ten); and it is one of 
380 universities that participate in IIE’s Open Doors snapshot survey. Snapshot survey data show 
that  the  number  of  international  undergraduates  enrolled  at  the  University  increased  19.7%  in 
FA13  compared  to  FA12,  and  enrollment  increased  87.6%  in  FA12  compared  to  fall  2011 
(FA11) (IIE, 2013a). 

The  University’s  increase  in  international  undergraduates  has  been  accompanied  by  a 
campus-wide  generalization  that  these  students,  as  a  whole,  are  struggling  academically  due  to 
deficient English skills which are inadequate to meet the University’s academic requirements and 
challenges  (cf.  Bretag,  2007).  If  international  undergraduates  experience  academic  struggles 
which are due to deficient English skills, then one and the same internationals who struggle with 
English would be expected to struggle academically also. This expectation has some support in the 
research literature on the TOEFL. TOEFL scores not only have been used in making admissions

decisions  (Oliver,  Vanderford  &  Grote,  2012),  but  also  in  predicting  English  proficiency  (Ling, 
Powers  &  Adler,  2014)  and  academic  success  (reviewed  by  Andrade,  2006;  Graham,  1987; 
Stoynoff,  1997).  For  instance,  Johnson  (1988)  found  that  international  undergraduates  whose 
TOEFL scores were below 500 earned significantly lower grades than counterparts whose TOEFL 
scores were at or above 500. Johnson concluded that the lower a student’s English proficiency (as 
reflected by the TOEFL  score), the more important its role in academic success. Johnson (1988) 
also found that international undergraduates whose TOEFL score was at the low end of its range 
were  more  successful  academically  in  courses  that  required  a  low  level  of  English  skills  than  in 
ones that required a high level. These findings suggest that international undergraduates’ English 
struggles (as indicated by low TOEFL scores) are associated with academic struggles (as indicated 
by low grades) at American universities. 

Although  the  research  literature  provides  some  support  for  using  TOEFL  scores  in 
predicting  English  proficiency  and  academic  success  (Ling,  Powers  &  Adler,  2014),  it  also 
provides  some  contradictory  evidence.  Several  studies  have  shown  no  correlation  between 
TOEFL  scores  and  international  undergraduates’  GPA  at  American  universities  (Chen  &  Sun, 
2006;  Fass-Holmes  &  Vaughn,  2014;  Wongtriat,  2010).  The  absence  of  a  correlation  between 
TOEFL scores and academic success might signify that the scores meet admissions requirements 
due  to  non-native  English  speaking  students’  having  attended  test  preparation  classes  (Hamp-
Lyons, 1998; Raimes, 1990) and/or cheating (Jung, 2013), but they do not reflect the students’ 
English  proficiency.  TOEFL  scores  therefore  might  have  limited  usefulness  in  resolving  the 
question of whether international undergraduates’ English struggles are associated with academic 
struggles at American universities (Des Brisay, 1994; Fass-Holmes & Vaughn, 2014). 

Instead  of  using  TOEFL  scores  as  an  indicator  of  English  proficiency  that  predicts 
academic  success,  a  recent  study  (Fass-Holmes  &  Vaughn,  2014)  compared  the  percentage  of 
degree-seeking  international  freshmen  who  were  required  to  take  EC  and/or  ESL  community 
college classes (i.e., struggling with English) with the percentage whose term GPAs during their 
first academic year were below 2.0 (struggling academically). More than one-third of the cohort 
that  entered  the  University  in  FA09,  almost  one-half  of  the  cohort  that  entered  in  FA10,  and 
almost  two-thirds  of  the  cohort  that  entered  in  FA11  were  required  to  take  the  community 
college classes. Five percent of the FA09 cohort, 10% of the FA10 cohort, and 42% of the FA11 
cohort  earned  D  or  F  (struggled)  in  these  classes.  However,  these  same  students  earned  mean 
GPAs  between  3.2  and  3.3  (succeeded  academically)  and  less  than  10%  earned  term  GPAs 
below 2.0 (struggled academically) in their University classes. These findings therefore suggest 
that  a  majority  of  the  international  freshmen  succeeded  academically  despite  evidence  of 
struggling with English. 

 

Research Method 

 
To  fulfill  the  request  by  the  College  Writing  Programs’  directors,  demographic  and  academic 
achievement  data  for  AY2009–10  through  2013–14,  inclusive,  were  extracted  from  the 
University’s student information system using structured query language (SQL) programs (only 
fall  terms’  results  are  reported  below;  other  terms’  results  are  available  from  the  authors  upon 
request). The demographic data included academic status (good vs. not good; not good included 
probation,  subject  to  dismissal,  and  dismissed),  admit  term  (which  was  used  to  compute  a 
calculated field enrollment history indicating whether each student was new or continuing), class 
level  (freshman,  sophomore,  etc.),  citizenship  country,  course  title,  department,  major,  subject

code  (which  was  used  to  compute  a  calculated  field  English  intensive-writing  programs  to 
distinguish  students  who  attended  College  Writing  Programs’  classes  from  students  who 
attended  the  community  college  writing  classes),  and  visa  status  (United  States  Department  of 
State,  n.d.).  Academic  achievement  data  included  marks  in  the  College  Writing  Programs’ 
(CWP)  and  community  college’s  (CC)  English  intensive-writing  classes  plus  term  GPAs.  The 
SQL programs also extracted each undergraduate’s unique campus ID and first and last names to 
facilitate  accurate  organization  (using  IRB-approved  procedures)  of  all  data  within  records 
within  data  files.  The  extractions  excluded  only  domestic  students  because  of  their  lack  of 
relevance to this study’s goals. 

Descriptive statistical analyses were performed (using spreadsheet and PSPP software) on 
the  data  files  to  characterize  the  undergraduates  and  to  determine  the  extent  to  which  they 
struggled  (earned  marks  below  C)  in  the  CWP  or  CC  classes.  HLM  analyses  were  performed 
(using STATA 13 software; StataCorp, 2013) to evaluate the role of individual-level variables on 
academic marks.  All of the present study’s models were run with one predictor at a time (or set 
of predictors, in the case of multiple groups like citizenship country or department). The outcome 
variable  (academic  marks)  was  nested  within  student;  therefore,  writing  classes’  marks  were 
level 1 whereas the students’ more stable traits (e.g., citizenship country) were level 2. Most of 
the  categorical  predictors  were  dummy-coded,  including  citizenship  country  (i.e.,  China  vs.  all 
others;  South  Korea  vs.  all  others;  these  were  the  citizenship  countries  of  the  University’s  two 
largest nonresident populations), English intensive-writing programs (i.e., CWP vs. CC classes), 
enrollment history (i.e., new student vs. continuing), immigration status (i.e., F-1 vs. all others; 
PR  vs.  all  others;  United  States  Department  of  State,  n.d.),  and  major  departments  (i.e., 
Economics vs. all others; engineering vs. all others; science vs. all others; these specific major 
departments  were  chosen  because  of  campus-wide  generalizations  that  undergraduates  whose 
native language was not English gravitated toward majors which were less sensitive to English 
weaknesses; cf. Johnson, 1988). Class level retained its ordinal form (i.e., freshman, sophomore, 
junior, senior). 

 

Results 

 
Descriptive Analyses—Demographics 
 
The  total  number  and  demographic  characteristics  of  nonresident  undergraduates  attending  the 
CWP’s  and  CC’s  English  intensive-writing  classes  in  the  fall  terms  of  AY2009–10  through 
2013–14,  inclusive,  are  shown  in  Table  1.  Several  noteworthy  trends  are  evident.  While  PR 
accounted  for  about  two-thirds  of  these  undergraduates  in  FA09  and  FA10,  F-1  accounted  for 
about two-thirds in FA12 and FA13. China was the citizenship country for less than 25% of the 
writing classes’ participants in FA09 and FA10, then it increased to almost 50% by FA13. Also 
in FA13, about one-third of the nonresident undergraduates attending writing classes were in the 
CC’s; this value was up from less than 20% in FA09. Engineering and science majors comprised 
approximately  half  of  the  undergraduates  in  the  writing  classes  between  FA09  and  FA13,  and 
less than 10% of participants in these classes were in bad academic status. 

The  annual  change  in  numbers  of  nonresident  undergraduates  attending  the  English 
intensive-writing  classes  between  FA09  and  FA13,  inclusive,  is  shown  in  Figure  1. 
Approximately  the  same  number  of  these  students  attended  in  FA10  as  in  FA09.  However,  in 
FA11,  participation  in  these  writing  classes  increased  by  about  10%,  then  by  almost  a  third  in

FA12 and in FA13. These increases were largely attributable to  year-over-year increases in the 
number  of  F-1  undergraduates  attending  these  classes  (Figure  2)  and  the  number  whose 
citizenship country was China (Figure 3).

Descriptive Analyses—Performance in English Intensive-Writing Classes 
 

Figure 4 shows nonresident undergraduates’ academic marks in English intensive-writing 
classes for FA09 through FA13, inclusive. F-1, OT, and PR undergraduates’ average marks were 
at or above C+ in these classes (aggregated over all citizenship countries and writing programs). 
Nonresident  undergraduates’  average  marks  were  between  B-  and  B  in  the  CWP  classes 
(aggregated over all citizenship countries and visa categories; United States Department of State, 
n.d.).  However,  their  average  marks  ranged  between  C-  and  C+  in  the  CC  classes  (same

Whereas  the  CWPs’  frequency  distributions  are  skewed  to  the  right,  the  CC  program’s 
frequency distribution approximates a bell curve. Out of 1,033 marks issued by the FA13 CWPs’ 
classes,  87.6%  were  at  or  above  C;  the  modal  mark  was  B  (N=222;  21.5%  of  the  total).  The 
corresponding  values  for  the  FA13  CC  program’s  classes  were  698,  74.1%,  and  C  (N=351; 
50.3% of the total), respectively. Frequency distributions for the other academic years’ fall terms 
show a similar pattern and are available from the authors upon request. 

 

 

Descriptive Analyses—GPAs 
 

The  University  considers  students  with  a  term  GPA  below  2.0  (C)  to  be  struggling 
academically.  GPA  analyses  showed  that  nonresident  undergraduates  who  participated  in  the 
English  intensive-writing  classes  earned  term  GPAs  which  averaged  between  2.7  (B-)  and  3.2 
(between B and B+) in FA09 through FA13, inclusive. Disaggregating the data by visa category, 
the fall average GPAs ranged from 2.98 to 3.17 for F-1, 2.55 to 2.93 for OT, and 2.92 to 3.01 for 
PR.  Disaggregating  by  writing  programs,  the  fall  average  GPAs  ranged  from  2.92  to  3.04  for 
nonresident  undergraduates  who  participated  in  CWP  classes  (the  University  includes  these 
classes’  academic  marks  in  term  GPAs),  and  2.95  to  3.14  for  participants  in  CC  classes  (the 
University  excludes  these  classes’  academic  marks  from  term  GPAs).  Chinese  undergraduates’ 
fall  average  GPAs  ranged  from  3.13  to  3.25,  South  Koreans’  from  2.72  to  2.96,  and  other 
countries’ from 2.94 to 3.03. The corresponding fall average GPAs for Economics majors ranged 
from  2.79  to  2.97,  for  engineering  majors  from  3.00  to  3.07,  for  science  majors  from  3.06  to 
3.21, and for other majors from 2.95 to 3.07. Tables and graphs of these data are available from 
the authors upon request.

 HLM Analyses 
 

The  data  extracted  for  the  HLM  analyses  yielded  1,189  nonresident  undergraduates’ 
records  for  AY2009–10  CWP  and  CC  classes,  and  these  undergraduates  had  a  total  of  2,331 
writing  classes’  marks  used  in  the  HLM  analyses.  On  average,  each  undergraduate  in  AY0910 
had about two writing classes’ marks (M = 1.9). The corresponding values for AY2010–11 were 
1,254  nonresident  undergraduates,  2,262  writing  classes’  marks,  and  an  average  of  almost  two 
writing  classes’  marks  per  student  (M  =  1.8).  For  AY2011–12,  1,366  nonresident 
undergraduates, 2,526 writing classes’ marks, and an average of almost two classes’ marks (M = 
1.8)  per  student.  For  AY2012–13,  1,703  nonresident  undergraduates,  3,514  writing  classes’ 
marks,  and  an  average  of  two  classes’  marks  per  student  (M  =  2.1).  Lastly,  for  AY2013–14, 
2,150 nonresident undergraduates, 4,296 writing classes’ marks, and an average of two classes’ 
marks per student (M = 2.0). 

In the current study, all of our models were run with one predictor (or set of predictors – 
in the case of dummy-coded predictors)  at a time on two-level models.  Writing classes’ marks 
(the outcome variable) are considered a lower level (level 1 or time-varying) variable, whereas 
the various predictors are considered higher level (level 2 or individual, stable) variables. These 
included citizenship country, class level, enrollment history, English intensive-writing programs, 
major  department,  and  visa  category  (United  States  Department  of  State,  n.d.).  An  example 
model is shown below. 

 
Level 1: Grade = β0j + rij 
Level 2: β0j = γ00 + γ01 (class level) + µ 0j 

 
 
 

For each HLM model, only statistically significant results (p<.05) are presented in Table 
2.  This  table  shows  that  class  level  was  a  significant  predictor  of  AY2009–10  writing  classes’ 
marks—as  class  level  increased,  these  marks  also  increased.  Citizenship  country,  English 
intensive-writing  programs,  enrollment  history,  major  department,  and  visa  category  all  were 
significant predictors of writing classes’ marks—Chinese and South Koreans, CWP participants, 
and continuing nonresident undergraduates had higher writing classes’ marks compared to other 
nationalities, CC writing classes’ participants, and new nonresident undergraduates. Economics 
and engineering majors and F-1 undergraduates had lower writing classes’ marks compared to all 
other majors and visa categories.  The HLM results for AY2010–11 writing classes’ marks were 
the same with one exception—only Economics  majors had lower  grades when  compared to all 
other majors (engineering majors were not significantly different from the rest). The results for 
AY2011–12  were  also  the  same  as  AY2009–10’s  except  that  major  department  was  not  a 
significant predictor at all. AY2012–13’s results were similar to AY2010–11‘s except that only 
Economics  majors  had  lower  marks  in  writing  classes  when  compared  to  all  other  majors 
(engineering  majors  were  not  significantly  different  from  the  rest).  AY2013–14’s  HLM  results 
were  similar  to  AY2009–10’s  with  two  exceptions—enrollment  history  was  not  a  significant 
predictor  and  only  Economics  majors  had  lower  marks  when  compared  to  all  other  majors 
(engineering majors were not significantly different from the rest). 

Although the HLM analyses revealed that the aforementioned predictors were statistically 
significant, most of them accounted for only a small portion of the total variance (less than 6%; 
small effect sizes) in writing classes’ marks. However, two exceptions were notable—class level 
explained 3–18% (small effect size) of the total variance in writing classes’ marks, and English

intensive-writing  programs  (CC  and  CWP)  explained  9–27%  (small  effect  size)  of  the  total 
variance in writing classes’ marks.

Discussion and Conclusions 

 

The present study tested the hypothesis that if the University’s nonresident undergraduates had 
English  deficiencies  despite  having  a  TOEFL  score  that  was  acceptable  for  admission,  they 
might  be  expected  to  struggle  (earn  Ds  or  Fs)  in  English  intensive-writing  classes.  To  the 
contrary,  this  study  showed  that  a  sizable  majority  of  these  students  earned  C  or  better  in 
AY2009–10 through 2013–14, inclusive. 

One  of  the  goals  in  testing  this  hypothesis  was  to  evaluate  the  degree  to  which  the 
University’s  nonresident  undergraduates  struggle  in  English  intensive-writing  classes.  The  only 
evidence of English struggles in this study was the average academic marks in the CC program’s 
classes (EC and ESL) in FA11 and FA13. Otherwise, this study’s results indicate that, regardless 
of how the data were disaggregated, the University’s nonresident undergraduates earned at least 
C on average in the English intensive-writing classes; in many cases instead, these students’ 
 average marks in the English intensive-writing classes were at or above B-.

This study’s other goal was to use HLM for identifying what variables predict struggles in the 
English  intensive-writing  classes.  The  HLM  results  showed  that  the  predictor  variable  English 
intensive-writing  programs  was  statistically  significant  and  explained  a  larger  percentage—9–
27%—of the total variance in writing classes’ marks than any of the other significant predictor 
variables. While this predictor’s coefficient suggests a difference of about one letter grade (e.g., 
D vs. C; B vs. A), the percentage of the total variance that it explains is considered a small effect 
size  (Cohen,  1988). It  might  be  sufficiently  compelling  for  use  in  decision  making  about 
implementing or changing policies and programs that target nonresident undergraduates at risk of 
bad academic status, but it might not be sufficiently compelling for nonresident undergraduates 
who  are  earning  B  or  A.  All  of  the  other  significant  predictor  variables  in  the  HLM  analyses 
explained  even  smaller  percentages  of  the  total  variance  and  thus  might  not  be  sufficiently 
compelling (Kirk, 1996). 

What  accounts  for  the  finding  that  nonresident  undergraduates’  marks  are  significantly 
worse in CC classes than in CWP counterparts? CC and CWP classes are similar in that they all 
are  taught  on  the  same  university  campus.  These  classes  are  dissimilar,  however,  in  that  the 
former  are  administered  and  taught  by  CC  instructors  whereas  the  latter  are  administered  and 
taught by the University’s faculty (cf. Callahan & Chumney, 2009). One possible explanation for 
the HLM results, then, is that CC instructors teach and/or grade English writing differently than 
the University’s faculty. Another possibility is that CC classes (EC and ESL) are focused more 
on  fundamental  English  skills  and  those  classes’  grades  consequently  are  more  reflective  of 
struggles  with  English,  whereas  the  CWP  classes  are  more  focused  on  writing  in  a  particular 
field  (e.g.,  humanities)  and  those  classes’  grades  consequently  are  less  reflective  of  struggles 
with English. A third possibility is that students might invest less time and effort in CC classes 
than in CWP classes because the University excludes the former and includes the latter in GPA 
calculations. Further research will be necessary to evaluate these possibilities. 

The  present  findings  further  refute  campus  generalizations  that  the  University’s 
nonresident  undergraduates  collectively  struggle  academically,  and  that  the  academic  struggles 
are  due  to  English  deficiencies  (cf.  Fass-Holmes  &  Vaughn,  2014).  These  generalizations  of 
extensive academic struggles and English deficiencies cannot readily be attributed to insufficient 
assistance and/or support; the University historically has delivered a diverse range of programs 
and  services—academic  and  immigration  advising,  intramural  sports,  mentoring  and  transition 
programs,  one-on-one  English  tutoring,  social  and  cultural  events,  student  organizations, 
welcoming  events,  etc.—to  promote 
its  non-native  English  speaking  undergraduates’ 
engagement, retention,  and satisfaction. However, the present findings do not refute or address 
additional  generalizations  about  nonresident  undergraduates’  behaviors  that  violate  academic 
integrity policies (e.g., cheating, collaboration, plagiarism, etc.). Further studies will be needed to 
determine  the  extent  to  which  such  behaviors  account  for  nonresident  undergraduates’ 
performance in English intensive-writing classes. 

The present study’s findings additionally rule out two alternative explanations for alleged 
English  deficiencies:  (a)  the  struggling  undergraduates  include  immigrant  students  (applicants 
for  permanent  residency,  amnesty-seekers,  asylees,  refugees,  OT,  and/or  PR)  rather  than  or  in 
addition  to  non-immigrant  (international)  students;  and  (b)  continuing,  rather  than  new, 
international  undergraduates  are  the  ones  who  struggle.  This  study  showed  that  OT  and  PR 
undergraduates had better marks in the English intensive-writing classes than non-immigrant F-1 
counterparts  (Figure  4;  Table  2),  and  that  continuing  nonresident  undergraduates  had  better 
marks  than  new  counterparts  (Table  2).  These  findings  are  the  opposite  of  what  would  be 

 
 

Journal of International Students  | 332 

expected if the above alternatives were correct. Instead, a recent study provided evidence that the 
University’s  generalizations  are  more  likely  attributable  to  annual  increases  in  international 
undergraduates entering the University. As international undergraduate enrollment has increased, 
the number of these students who struggle academically also has increased proportionally (Fass-
Holmes & Vaughn, 2014). 

 

In  conclusion,  only  a  minority  of  the  University’s  nonresident  undergraduates  has 
struggled  in  English  intensive-writing  classes  and/or  academically.  This  finding  is  contrary  to 
expectations  originating  from  campus-wide  generalizations  about  nonresident  undergraduates. 
Policies  and  programs  intended  to  promote  undergraduates’  academic  success  would  be  most 
cost effective if they focused on the specific students with demonstrable deficiencies rather than 
all who are not native English writers.

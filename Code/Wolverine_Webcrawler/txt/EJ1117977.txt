Abstract 

This  study  primarily  aims  to  (1)  examine  the  relationship  between  foreign  language  reading 
proficiency and eye movements during reading, and (2) to describe eye movement differences between 
two CEFR proficiency groups (B1 and B2) by using eye tracking technique. 57 learners of EFL were 
tested  under  two  experimental  conditions:  Natural  L2  reading  and  isolated  sentence  stimulus.  The 
results  revealed  that  total  fixation  duration  and  first  pass  time  were  predicted  significantly  by  L2 
reading  proficiency  in  both  experiments  while  second  pass  time  and  single  fixation  duration  were 
found to be stimulus sensitive. Furthermore, B2 learners were observed to have less total fixation, first 
pass and second pass time and rate in both experiments when compared to B1 learners. The findings 
confirmed that characteristics of eye movements change as L2 reading skill develops. The use of eye 
tracking technique in future language classrooms to observe L2 learner reading development was also 
discussed.

1. Introduction 

Human  beings  were  never  born  to  read  in  their  native  language,  it  is  a  challenging  skill  which 
develops in time by educational progresses. This development becomes obviously more laborious for 
an  additional  language,  especially  after  a  certain  age.  Surely,  reading  is  a  fundamental  skill  in  a 
foreign language (L2) and also a must to be a proficient language user. L2 Learners, however, meet 
numerous complexities in their reading progress. Reading in L2 is prone to crosslinguistic effects in 
which  first  language  (L1)  interferes  L2  reading  learning:  This  dual-language  process  refers  to 
“continual  interactions  between  the  two  languages”  (Koda,  2007).  Meanwhile,  L2  learners  need  to 
meet the specific demands of L2 including grammar, syntax, vocabulary, morphology etc. Thus, while 
foreign  language  learners  are  exposed  to  crosslinguistic  effects,  they  are  also  required  to  develop 
lexical, syntactic and morphological aspects in a totally new language to be a proficient comprehender

in reading (Koban-Koç, 2016). Furthermore, L1 and L2 reading are totally different developmental 
processes.  First  language  and  foreign  language  readers  begin  to  learn  to  read  from  very  different 
starting  points  (Grabe,  2010).  According  to  L1  reading  research,  L1  children  who  begins  to  learn 
reading typically know 5,000 to 8,000 words already before formal education (Singer, 1981; Anglin, 
1993;  Cunningham,  2005).  In  addition,  L1  beginners  has  a  considerable  amount  of  morphological, 
phonological  and  syntactic  knowledge  of  their  native  language  due  to  their  social  context  before 
formal reading instruction. On the other hand, beginner L2 learners in foreign language context start to 
learn L2 reading after a certain age (approximately after 7 years old) without any previous linguistic 
knowledge. These learners neither have such a social opportunity and a large mental lexicon nor have 
basic linguistic knowledge of target language before formal reading instruction. For an L2 learner, it 
will take several years to develop strong implicit knowledge of vocabulary, morphology, syntax, and 
phonology which are vital for proper reading comprehension (Grabe, 2010). Thus, foreign language 
reading is both crosslinguistic and intralinguistic, bearing a more complex developmental nature when 
compared to first language reading. In this respect, eye movements can give valuable clues about how 
foreign  language  learners  progress  from  beginning  to  skilled  readers.  This  study  primarily  aims  to 
scrutinize  and  examine  developmental  eye  movement  characteristics  of  foreign  language  reading 
proficiency by using eye tracking in two experimental conditions.  

1.1. Literature review 

1.1.1. Developmental Eye Movements in First Language 

For  several  decades,  eye  tracking  has  been  accepted  as  a  robust  technique  to  examine 
developmental differences in reading ability. Many studies showed that reading proficiency and eye 
movements are closely associated: As reading proficiency develops, fixation duration, regressions and 
fixation  count  decreases  while  saccade  length  increases  (Rayner,  1998).  According  to  the  previous 
research,  beginning  readers  mean  fixation  duration  was  found  to  be  approximately  355ms,  fixation 
count  was  191  per  100  words  with  a  regression  rate  of  nearly  30%  (Taylor,  1965;  Buswell,  1922; 
Rayner,  1985;  McConkie  et  al  1991).  In  these  studies,  for  skilled  readers,  these  values  were  quite 
lower and were reported as 233ms, 94 and 14%, respectively.  Another study by Rayner (1978) also 
yielded fairly similar results for 10 skilled readers: Mean fixation duration was 216ms, saccade length 
was  8.1  letters  and  regression  rate  was  11%.  In  addition,  some  other  eye  movement  measures  also 
correlated with reading proficiency. McConkie et al. (1991) reported that beginning readers refixate on 
words more than skilled readers. Skilled adult readers refixated 5 letter words 15% of the time, while 
first  grade  beginner  children  refixated  5  letter  words  57%  of  the  time.  These  findings  were  also 
confirmed  by  some  other  studies  (Blythe,  Häikiö,  Bertam,  Liversedge,  &  Hyönä,  2011;  Joseph, 
Liversedge, Blythe, White, & Rayner, 2009). Furthermore, by using a moving window technique, the 
study  by  Rayner  (1986)  concluded  that  the  perceptual  span  of  beginning  readers  was  smaller  than 
skilled readers. The results revealed that the perceptual span of beginning readers extends about 11 
character spaces to the right of fixation and for skilled readers, the span extends 14–15 spaces to the 
right  of  fixation.  The  relationship  between  reading  proficiency  and  eye  movements  were  also 
confirmed  by  many  related  eye  movement  research  with  similar  findings  (Elterman,  Abel,  Daroff, 
Dell'Osso, & Bornstein, 1980; Martos & Vila, 1990; Eden, Stein, Wood, &Wood, 1995). 

1.1.2. Eye Tracking Research in L2 

In  contrast  to  L1  eye  movement  research  in  the  context  of  reading,  using  eye  tracking  as  a 
technique  to  explore  L2  topics  has  recently  started  to  become  trendy.  Research  by  Godfroid  et  al. 
(2013) scrutinized the noticing hypothesis and incidental vocabulary acquisition during reading with 
28 participants. The results indicated that one second more attention on a pseudo-word increased its 
recognition probability in post-test by 8%. In a similar research, Smith (2012) focused on the role of 

240  Emrah Dolgunsöz, Arif Sarıçoban / Journal of Language and Linguistic Studies, 12(2) (2016) 238-252 

 

eye tracking in measuring noticing during SCMC with 18 participants. In this research, participants 
engaged  in  an  online  short  chat  interaction  task  with  a  native  speaker.  Remarkably,  this  research 
triangulated  eye  tracking  and  stimulated  recall  data  reporting  that  eye  tracking  was  a  promising 
technique  to  investigate  attention  in  SLA.  In  another  research,  Winke  et  al.  (2013b)  analyzed  the 
caption-reading  behavior  of  foreign  language  learners  by  using  eye  tracking  methodology  in  a 
crosslinguistic  prespective.  The  findings  revealed  that  native  language  significantly  affected  the 
reading times in a foreign language: Arabic learners are found to spend more time on captions than 
other learners from different languages and Chinese learners are observed to have spent comparatively 
less  time  on  captions  in  the  unfamiliar  content  video.  Siyanova  et  al.  (2011)  used  eye  tracking  to 
scrutinize the idiom processing of L2 learners. They used metaphoric expressions as stimulus with 36 
learners participating in their research. According to their results native speakers were better at idiom 
processing when compared to non-natives. In addition, non-natives were observed to have processed 
idioms  and  novel  words  at  identical  speed.  Research  by  Liu  (2014)  examined  the  effect  of 
morphological  instruction  in  a  second  language  bu  using  eye  tracking.  In  this  between-subjects 
research, 68 learners received traditional and morphological instruction on vocabulary learning for 7 
weeks.  According  to  the  results,  learners  who  received  morphological  instruction  showed  higher 
fixation-duration  on  morpheme  areas,  while  other  learners  did  not  show  the same  sort  of  behavior. 
Recently, the study by Kim et al (2015) examined the binding theory and scrutinized how adult L2 
learners  make  use  of  grammatical  and  extragrammatical  information  to  interpret  reflexives  and 
pronouns  by  using  eye  tracking.  They  investigated  the  interpretation  of  reflexives  (himself)  and 
pronouns (him) in contexts where there is a potential co-argument antecedent and in the context of 
picture noun phrases (a picture of him/himself), where the distribution of reflexives and pronouns can 
overlap. The results revealed that the L2 learners interpreted reflexives in a native like fashion in both 
contexts, however they interpreted pronouns differently from native speakers, despite their advanced 
English  proficiency.  Using  eye-tracking,  Godfroid  et  al  (2015)  studied  the  grammatical  judgment 
ability of L2 learners with 20 native and 40 nonnative English speakers without time pressure.  The 
results indicated that time pressure suppressed regressions in nonnative speakers only and both groups 
regressed  more  on  untimed,  grammatical  items.  The  findings  revealed  that  timed  and  untimed 
grammatical judgment tests measure implicit and explicit knowledge, respectively. 

In sum, eye tracking research in L2 mainly focused on attention-learning relationship, implicit and 
explicit knowledge in L2 and crosslinguistic differences in language processing. Among these studies, 
however, none of them focused on characteristics of developmental eye movements in L2 reading and 
gave a detailed description of eye movement measures between L2 reading proficiency levels.  

1.1.3. Eye Movements Examined in Current Research 

Eye tracking refers to the online registration of eye movements via infrared illumination. Simply 
put, infrared reflected onto the cornea pursues eye movements on a screen or in natural environments 
with the help of a micro camera. The movements of the eye are registered with the aid of a dedicated 
eye tracking software. In visual information processing including reading, two main eye movements 
are examined: fixations (the place and duration of the eye fixation) and saccades (ballistic and rapid 
movements of the eye from one point  to another). This examination fundamentally depends on the 
“Eye-Mind Hypothesis” (Just & Carpenter, 1980) which assumes that eye movements and cognitive 
processes are closely linked. In this research, 4 types of fixational eye movements were analyzed: First 
Pass Time (gaze duration), total fixation duration, second pass time and single fixation duration. 

First pass time refers to the successive fixations made on a word to the right of the text until the 
region is exited. In the hypothetical case given above, fixation#1+2 on the word “American” refers to 
first  pass  time  for  this  word.    Single  fixation  duration  is  calculated  when  reader  makes  only  one 
fixation  on  a  word  and  exits  the  region.  In  the  example  above,  fixation#3  refers  to  single  fixation 

Emrah Dolgunsöz, Arif Sarıçoban / Journal of Language and Linguistic Studies, 12(2) (2016) 238-252 

241 

duration as the reader employed one fixation on the word “farmer” and exited the region. Second pass 
time is the measure which is calculated when a participant exits the AOI by making a forward saccade 
or a regressive saccade but then returns to the same AOI and rereads it. As indicated in the scanpath 
example, reader rereads and reanalyzes the word “produced” by operationalizing fixation#6. As the 
most common eye movement index, total fixation duration (fixation#4+6) for the word “produced” 
refers to the sum of all fixations on the related AOI. Total fixation duration is therefore calculated by 
summing  any  fixation  duration  on  the  related  AOI  by  dismissing  its  characteristic  features  such  as 
whether or not it follows a regression or a second pass.  

Remarkably, these measures can give informative clues about the reading process. First pass time 
indicates processes associated with early word recognition skills such as recognition of orthography, 
phonology and morphology and lexical access (Clifton et al 2007). Inflated values for first pass signal 
problems with initial word recognition processes and lexical access. As a late measure, total fixation 
duration is a general panorama giving clues about the overall cognitive load, reading efficiency and 
word familiarity. Similarly, second pass time is more syntactic and discursive associated with delayed 
effects such as reanalysis of syntactic structure (Hyöna et al. 2003). Inflated values in this measure 
indicate an inability to recognize the word in a sentential construct. This measure is also informative 
about strategy use during reading. Both second pass time and total fixation duration are late stages of 
processing and may be an indicative of the interruption to the normal reading process (Frenck-Mestre, 
2005; Winke et al. 2013a). Single fixation duration, on the other hand, is a special early case which is 
an  indicative  of  rapid  word  recognition.  This  measure  was  found  to  be  highly  sensitive  to  word 
frequency and familiarity effects (Juhasz et al. 2003) and may be considered to be fairly associated 
with  automaticity  in  word  recognition  during  reading.  Second  pass  rate  refers  to  the  measure 
indicating the rate of the words the reader employed second pass time, such as 10 of 15 words as 66%. 
Single fixation rate is also similar which refers to the rate of the words passed by single fixation, such 
as  10  of  20  words  with  single  fixation  equals  to  50%  single  fixation  rate.  Different  from  duration 
based calculations, single fixation rate and second pass rate draws a general panorama.  

1.2. Research questions 

This research aims primarily to examine the effect of foreign language reading proficiency on eye 
movements  during  L2  reading  and  to  reveal  eye  movement  differences  among  two  (B1-lower 
intermediate,  B2-upper  intermediate)  EFL  reading  proficiency  groups.  The  present  research  is 
significant  because  in  contrast  to  previous  research  which  mainly  examined  eye  movements  of  L2 
learners  on  different  language  processing  conditions,  this  study  aims  to  reveal  developmental 
characteristics  of  eye  movements  across  two  foreign  language  reading  proficiency  groups  by 
scrutinizing  4  measures  regarding  different  L2  reading  proficiency  groups.  These  differences  are 
significant  as  they  are  precisely  informative  about  the  developmental  progress  of  foreign  language 
reader  behavior.  Additionally,  the  results  of  this  study  may  lead  to  the  further  use  of  eye  tracking 
technique for the online observation L2 learner reading development. Two main research questions 
were addressed: 

1-What is the effect of reading proficiency on 4 eye movements in foreign language reading? 
2-Is there a statistically significant difference among two proficiency groups regarding first pass 

time, total fixation duration, single fixation duration and second pass time?

2. Method 
2.1. Sample / Participants 

57 participants took part in all procedures of the experiments and received course credit for their 
participation. All participants were learners of English as a foreign language in two different foreign 
language reading proficiency levels (B1= 24, B2=33). The age of the participants was within the range 
19 to 22. All of the participants started to learn English after a certain age in a non-English speaking 
country  with  the  same  L1  background.  In  total,  57  participants  (10  males  and  47  females)  were 
included in the data analysis. All participants had normal or corrected to normal eyesight. 

2.2. Designing and Defining AOIs 

This research includes two eye tracking experiments. All participants were exposed to the same 
two  experimental  conditions  in  which  35  words  were  used  as  areas  of  interest  (AOIs).  As  eye 
movements were quite sensitive to length and frequency effects (Rayner and McConkie, 1976; Inhoff 
and  Rayner,  1986;  Rayner  and  Duffy,  1986),  length  and  frequency  of  the  words  were  kept 
homogenous;  both  long  and  short;  frequent  and  infrequent  vocabulary  items  were  used.  Word 
frequency was determined by using COCA (Corpus of Contemporary American English). The AOIs 
used in the experiments are as follows:

2.3. Text Stimuli 

In experiment 1, eye movements during natural foreign language reading process were recorded. 
For this purpose, a passage from a sample IELTS General Reading (International English Language 
Testing System) was used. The natural reading passage comprised 203 words, 1297 characters and 11 
sentences.  For  experiment  2,  10  identical  sentence  frames  (see  Juhasz  and  Pollatsek,  2011,  p.875) 
including  20  different  words  with  different  frequencies  and  length  were  presented  within  the  same 
syntax  pairs.  This  experiment  involved  275  words  and  1205  characters.  To  control  frequency  and 
length effects, in each pair, two different conditions were used: Short-high frequency words versus 
long-low  frequency  words  and  short-low  frequency  words  versus  long-high  frequency  words.    The 
pairs were presented one by one.   

2.4. Vocabulary Test 

To  assess  participant  familiarity  on  35  AOIs  in  total,  a  vocabulary  knowledge  scale  as 
unannounced vocabulary test (see Scarcella and Zimmerman, 1998; Wesche and Paribakht, 1996) was 
used. In this test, learners were required to choose the best of 3 options: “I know the word”; “I am 
familiar but not sure”; and “I have no idea”. If one of the first 2 options were chosen, participants were 
asked to write the Turkish meaning(s) or their predictions about the word. The familiarity option was 
used  to  ensure  that  learners  had  minimal  word  recognition  on  a  certain  word.  The  scores  were 
determined by calculating how many words were exactly known by the learners (1st option in the test). 

2.5. Apparatus 

Eye movements were recorded with the Tobii TX300 with a sampling rate of 300Hz, equivalent to 
a temporal resolution of 3.3ms.  For eye movement data acquisition, visualization and analysis, Tobii 
Studio Enterprise Software 3.2.3 was used. 

2.6. Procedure 

All participants were volunteers, naïve to the research questions and tested individually. To define 
foreign language reading proficiency levels, a sample IELTS General Reading Exam was conducted 
before  the  experiments.  IELTS  General  Reading  Exam  is  an  international  exam  which  assesses 
reading proficiency in English language. Learner proficiency level is determined via 11 IELTS bands 
(from  4,  4.5  to  8.5,  9)  which  relies  on  how  many  questions  has  been  answered  correctly  by  the 
candidate.  These  bands  equal  to  6  different  CEFR  (Common  European  Framework  of  Reference) 
levels; A1-A2, B1-B2 and C1-C2 (see Verhelst et al 2009; Martyniuk, 2010). For this study, B1 (lower 
intermediate) and B2 (upper intermediate) learners were chosen as these groups were homogenous and 
most  common.  Before  starting  the  eye  tracking  session,  the  participants  individually  took  the 
vocabulary  test  at  least  1  hour  before  the  experiments  to  minimize  any  priming  effect.  Then  each 
participant  sat  for  the  eye  tracking  session  one  by  one  within  the  control  of  the  researcher.  In 
experiment 1, learners were instructed to read the passage silently for comprehension purposes. For 
the  second  experiment,  learners  were  instructed  to  read  sentence  pairs  for  comprehension  and  pass 
another  pair  when  they  were  ready.  To  avoid  anxiety  and  emotional  arousal  which  might  cause 
reactivity, no time limit was given. Calibration was done with a 9 point grid calibration setting. The 
stimuli were presented in Times New Roman, 18-pt font, on a 23’’ monitor with 1920x1080 screen 
resolution set up at 67 cm from the participants’ eyes.

3. Results 

The variables in the data set were observed to have distributed normally. All statistical assumptions 

were tested and met including normal distribution, linearity, sample size and outliers.  

3.1. Experiment 1: Natural L2 Reading Processes 

13.501, t(55) = 5.028, p =.000. IELTS scores also explained a significant proportion of variance in 

In  this  experiment,  participants  read  a  passage  and  eye  movements  in  natural  L2  reading  was 
analyzed. Linear regression with IELTS scores as the predictor variable and total fixation duration as 

the  dependent  variable  revealed  a  significant  effect  of  proficiency  on  total  fixation  duration; (cid:2010)(cid:2869)=  -
total fixation duration; (cid:1844)(cid:2870) = .315, F (1, 55) = 25.281, p = .000. A similar effect was also observed for 
first pass time; (cid:2010)(cid:2869)= -10.205, t(55)= 9.827, p =.000 with a significant explanation rate; (cid:1844)(cid:2870) = .212, F (1, 
predictive power; (cid:2010)(cid:2869)= 3.916, t(55) = .909, p =.034 and weak but significant explanatory power; (cid:1844)(cid:2870) = 

55)  =  14.837,  p  =  .000.  For  single  fixation  duration,  proficiency  effect  also  persisted  with  lower 

.079, F (1, 55) = 4.710, p = .034. No significant effect of proficiency was observed on second pass 
time. 

 
According to between subjects analysis, B2 learners (M=9, SD=2.1) significantly recognized more 
words and scored better in vocabulary test than B1 learners did (M=7, SD=2.1.); t(55)= 2.618, p = 
.011, d=1.00. Regarding eye movements, B1 learners were observed to have spent significantly more 
total  time  on  words  (M=538,  SD=77.18)  than  B2  learners  did  (M=426,  SD=89);  t(55)=  4.893,  p  = 
.000, d=1.33.  Similarly, first pass time for B1 learners (M=475, SD=91.24) were higher than of B2 
learners (M=389, SD=75.14); t(55)= 3.890, p = .000, d=1.01. Significantly, B2 learners (M=27, SD= 
31.23)  revisited  words  less  and  spent  less  time  for  second  pass  than  B1  learners  did  (M=56, 
SD=38.68); t(55)= 3.128, p = .003, d=0.81. Also, B2 learners have employed more single fixation time 
(M=163, SD=51.07) than B1 learners did (M=125, SD=60.69); t(55)= 2.535, p = .014, d= 0.61. Beside 
these, while refixation rate was 15% for B1 learners, this rate is only 9% for B2 learners. B2 learners 
also had a higher single fixation rate (52%) than B1 learners (35%). A detailed table is given below:

3.2. Experiment 2: Identical Sentence pairs process in L2 

In this experiment, participants read 10 pairs of sentences which bear same  syntax but different 
words that vary in length and frequency. Linear regression results with IELTS scores as the predictor 
variable  and  total  fixation  duration  as  the  dependent  variable  indicated  a  significant  effect  of 

proficiency  on  total  fixation  duration; (cid:2010)(cid:2869)=  -12.848,  t(55)  =  3.835,  p  =.000.  IELTS  scores  also 
explained a significant proportion of variance in total fixation duration; (cid:1844)(cid:2870) = .211, F (1, 55) = 15.708, 
p = .000. Likewise, proficiency also significantly predicted first pass time; (cid:2010)(cid:2869)= -7.571, t(55)= 7.884, p

=.008.  Proficiency  scores  explained  a  significant  proportion  of  variance  in  first  pass  time; (cid:1844)(cid:2870)  = 
time; (cid:2010)(cid:2869)=  -3.706,  t(55)  =  3.948,  p  =.009.  Proficiency  also  explained  a  significant  proportion  of 
variance  in  second  pass  time; (cid:1844)(cid:2870)  =  .119,  F  (1,  55)  =  7.428,  p  =  .009.  No  significant  effect  of 

.120, F (1, 55) = 7.522, p = .008. These two measures were observed to be fairly consistent with the 
results in experiment 1. However, findings on second pass time and single fixation duration was not 
confirmatory.  On  the  contrary  to  experiment  1,  proficiency  had  a  significant  effect  on  second  pass 

245 

proficiency was observed on single fixation duration. 

Similar  to  experiment  1,  between  subjects  analysis  of  experiment  2  showed  that  B2  learners 
(M=16,  SD=1.7)  significantly  recognized  more  words  and  scored  better  in  vocabulary  test  than  B1 
learners did (M=14, 2.4.); t(55)= 2.695, p = .009, d= .96. In terms of eye movements, it was observed 
that B1 learners spent significantly more total time on words (M=495, SD=104) than B2 learners did 
(M=396, SD=106); t(55)= 3.492, p = .001, d= .94.  Likewise, first pass time for B1 learners (M=419, 
SD=79) were higher than of B2 learners (M=356, SD=89); t(55)= 2.738, p = .008, d= .74. In addition, 
B1  learners  (M=61,  SD=  54)  revisited  words  more  and  spent  more  time  for  second  pass  than  B2 
learners  did  (M=35,  SD=31);  t(55)=  2.228,  p  =.030,  d=0.60.  For  single  fixation  duration,  no 
significant  difference  was  observed  between  groups.  Furthermore,  refixation  rates  were  highly 
consistent with the Experiment 1. While refixation rate was 15% for B1 learners, this rate is about 
10%  for  B2 learners.  Contrary  to  Experiment  1,  single  fixation  rates  were  observed  to  be  identical 
between groups; 56% for B2 learners and 52% for B1 learners. A detailed table is given below:

According to the results obtained from both experiments, total fixation duration was found to be 
highly  associated  with  proficiency.  The  findings  from  experiment  1  and  2  was  quite  consistent 
regarding total fixation duration reporting that total time spent on words increase as proficiency level 
decreases.  Related  eye  movement  research  showed  that  more  familiar  words  were  processed  more 
quickly  than  less  familiar  words;  readers  spend  less  time  on  familiar  words  and  more  time  on 
unfamiliar  words  (Gernsbaher,  1984;  Balota,  Pilotti&  Cortese,  2001;  Ferraro  and  Sturgill,  1998; 
Whalen and Zsiga, 1994). Indeed, better proficiency means better vocabulary knowledge; skilled L2 
readers possess a larger mental lexicon in L2 (Carver, 1994; Grabe, 2010). Thus, good learners with 
better vocabulary storage are less likely to meet unfamiliar words and spent less time on words during 
reading when compared to weak learners. In another aspect, when compared to first language values, 
L2  reading  total  fixation  values  were  highly  inflated.  In  related  L1  research,  mean  fixation  was 
reported about 355ms for beginning readers (Taylor, 1965; Buswell, 1922; Rayner, 1985; McConkie et 
al  1991).  According  to  the  findings  of  the  present  research,  even  upper  intermediate  (B2)  learners’ 
average  total  fixation  duration  from  two  experiments  (411ms)  is  higher  than  a  beginner  L1  reader. 
This difference indicates the significance of language exposure before starting to learn reading and 
how starting points for L1 reading and L2 reading as stated by Grabe (2010) are different from each 
other.    Another  robust  finding  of  this  research  is  that  first  pass  time  is  highly  correlated  with 
proficiency  level.  As  mentioned  above,  first  pass  time  is  an  early  measure  closely  associated  with 
initial word recognition processes and lexical access. According to the results, larger mental lexicon 
that better learners have led less first pass time. Weak learners, however, spent more first pass time on 
words due to their lesser vocabulary knowledge. In addition, better learners have better morphological 
knowledge and awareness (Liu, 2014) which enable them to spend less time on first pass.  

In terms of second pass time, data obtained from experiments were contradictory. While natural 
reading experiment showed no predictive power of proficiency on second pass time, identical pairs 
experiment  revealed  a  significant  effect  of  proficiency.  Although  regression  results  of  second  pass 
were  not  identical  in  two  experiments,  second  pass  time,  however,  was  found  to  be  significant  in 
between group analysis. It was observed that better learners refixate less on words while weaker ones 
reread them more. In addition, refixation rates in both experiments were highly consistent; B2 learners 
refixate  less  than  10%  while  this  rate  is  about  15%  for  B1  learners.  This  results  also  confirm 
McConkie  et  al.  (1991)  who  reported  that  beginning  readers  refixate  on  words  more  than  skilled 
readers. It can be inferred that with superior syntactic and lexical skills, better learners make better 
sense of words and their functions in the syntactic structure which enables less refixations and less 
second  pass  time.  In  another  perspective,  second  pass  time  can  be  evaluated  as  an  indicative  of 
strategy  use  during  L2  reading.  According  to  Zabrucky  and  Commander  (1998),  poor  learners 
generally reread more than skilled readers and good readers were better able to selectively direct their 
rereading  to  text  coherence  problems  and  had  better  text  memory  relative  to  poor  readers.  In  this 
respect,  better  learners  employ  rereading  strategy  more  efficiently  than  poor  learners  do  with  less 
second pass time and rate.  

Automaticity in word recognition is a vital component of reading proficiency. It refers to rapid and 
efficient word recognition ability which enables automatized and fluent reading (Grabe, 2010). Surely, 
automaticity is the core of parallel processing and a requirement of proficient reading ability (Samuels, 
1988;  Segalowitz,  2003;  Moors  &  De  Houwer,  2006;  Segalowitz  &  Hulstijn,  2005).  Developing 
automaticity requires time and continual practice; with the extended learning experience, the cognitive 
components underlying word recognition are automatized in L2 reading (Segalowitz et al. 1998). This 
research approached single fixation duration as an indicative of automaticity as this measure refers to 
making  only  one  fixation  on  the  related  linguistic  item  and  exiting  the  region.  The  results  of  the 
experiment 1 showed that L2 reading proficiency and single fixation duration were closely associated: 

Emrah Dolgunsöz, Arif Sarıçoban / Journal of Language and Linguistic Studies, 12(2) (2016) 238-252 

247 

Better  learners  had  higher  single  fixation  duration  and  higher  single  fixation  rate  (52%)  than  of 
weaker learners. Natural reading experiment indicated that better learners were better in recognizing 
words  with  a  single  fixation  and  so  more  rapid  in  word  recognition.  In  fact,  this  is  mainly  due  to 
higher vocabulary skills that B2 learners possess as rapid word recognition requires well developed 
lexical entries (Perfetti, 2007). However, same effect was not observed for Experiment 2. The main 
reason for that contradiction was linked to the nature of the stimuli. Natural reading stimuli triggered 
single fixation duration more while isolated sentence pairs led to less single fixation duration and more 
examination of the sentence area.  

 

5. Conclusions 

This study examined the effect of L2 reading proficiency on eye movements and scrutinized eye 
movement differences among two L2 proficiency groups during L2 reading. The primary finding of 
this  research  is  that  total  fixation  duration  and  first  pass  time  are  precisely  affected  by  proficiency 
regardless  of  stimuli  type.  During  both  natural  reading  and  isolated  reading  conditions,  L2  reading 
proficiency predicts total time and the initial time spent on words. Although regression results did not 
present  significant  results,  the  findings also  showed  that  better  learners  revisit  words  less  and  their 
refixation rate was lower in both experimental conditions. Besides, single fixation duration was found 
to  be  sensitive  towards  the  type  of  stimuli;  only  the  natural  reading  experiment  reported  expected 
results. Despite a number of contradictory findings, the present research showed that eye movements 
in  L2  reading  is  affected  by  reading  proficiency  in  general  terms  and  L2  learners  in  different  L2 
reading proficiency levels exhibited different eye movements during reading. Better L2 learners with 
better lexical and syntactic skills were observed to have less inflated values and less refixation time 
and rate. On the contrary, weak L2 readers spent more time on words and revisit words more. Natural 
reading  experiment  also  indicated  that  better  L2  readers  are  more  automatized  in  word  recognition 
regarding single fixation efficiency. Indeed these differences indicated that eye movements in L2 are 
somehow  proficiency  driven  and  their  characteristics  change  as  the  reading  ability  develops.  This 
developmental change can enable eye tracking technique as a medium for the online observation of L2 
reading development. The results of the present research also confirmed that eye tracking technique 
may  also  be  used  as  a  part  of  L2  reading  instruction  and  classroom  in  which  learners’  reading 
development is continuously observed to determine L2 reading challenges and solutions.

Appendix A.  Natural L2 reading Stimulus for Experiment 1 
AUSTRALIA 
Have you ever travelled to another part of your country and stayed for a few days? Travel within 
one's own country is popular throughout the world. And, according to a survey carried out in Australia 
in 2002, travellers are spending more and more money on their holidays. 

The  Domestic  Tourism  Expenditure  Survey  showed  that  domestic  travellers  –  those  travelling 
within the country – injected $23 billion into the Australian economy in 2002. As a result, domestic 
tourism  became  the  mainstay  of  the  industry,  accounting  for  75%  of  total  tourism  expenditure  in 
Australia. International tourism, on the other hand, added $7 billion to the economy.  

So, tourism has become one of Australia's largest industries. The combined tourist industry now 
accounts  for  about  5%  of  the  Australian  economy,  compared  with  agriculture  at  4.3%  and 
manufacturing at 8%. Tourism is therefore an important earner for both companies and individuals in a 
wide range of industries.  

For example, the transport industry benefits from the extra money poured into it. Hotels spring up 
in resort areas to provide accommodation, and the catering industry gains as tourists spend money in

251 

restaurants. The retail sector benefits as well, as many tourists use their holidays to shop for clothes, 
accessories and souvenirs.

süresi ve first pass süresi dil seviyesi tarafından önemli derecede belirlenirken, second pass ve single fixation 
süreleri uyarıcı endekslidir.  
Dahası, her iki deneyde de B2 seviyesindeki öğrenciler B1 öğrencilerine nazaran daha az total fixation, first pass 
ve  second  pass  oranları  harcamışlardır.  Bulgular  göstermiştir  ki  göz  hareketi  özellikleri  okuma  becerisinin 
gelişmesiyle  birlikte  farklılık  göstermektedir.  Bunun  yanı  sıra  gelecekte  öğrencilerin  okuma  davranışlarının 
çevrimiçi gözlemlenebilmesi için göz takip tekniğinin eğitim amaçlı kullanımının üzerinde durulmuştur.  
 
Anahtar sözcükler: Yabancı dilde okuma, göz hareketleri, göz takibi, yabancı dil okuma seviyesi

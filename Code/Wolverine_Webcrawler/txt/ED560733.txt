Executive Summary 
The 2008/12 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:08/12), conducted for the 

U.S. Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), is the second 
follow-up of a panel of baccalaureate degree recipients identified in the 2007–08 National 
Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:08). Four years after these students’ graduation from 
college, the 2012 study focuses on respondents’ postbaccalaureate education and employment. This 
report summarizes the methods used in B&B:08/12 and provides other technical details about the 
data collection, which took place during the 2012–13 academic year. The executive summary 
includes basic information about the following aspects of the study: sample design, interview design, 
interview data collection, administrative data collection, data file processing and preparation, and 
weighting and variance estimation. 

Sampling Design 

The B&B:08/12 respondent universe consisted of students who completed requirements for 

a bachelor’s degree between July 1, 2007, and June 30, 2008, at any Title IV eligible postsecondary 
institution in the United States and Puerto Rico. Identification of the B&B:08 cohort required a 
multistage process, beginning with NPSAS:08. First, a sample of institutions was selected from the 
NPSAS:08 universe of institutions. Second, a sample of students was selected from the sampled 
institutions. Third, sample members who were expected to complete a bachelor’s degree in the 
2007–08 academic year were confirmed as baccalaureate recipients during the NPSAS:08 interview 
and, therefore, identified as eligible for the B&B:08 cohort.  

Eligibility was reviewed again in the first follow-up, B&B:08/09. The B&B:08/12 sample 
included approximately 17,160 sample members and was comprised of all eligible B&B:08 cohort 
members as determined by B&B:08/09 transcripts or prior interviews.1 

Interview Design, Interview Data Collection Results, and Experiments 
The B&B:08/12 interview included items from interviews conducted with the B&B:93/03 

and B&B:2000/01 cohorts and on the B&B:08/09 interview. It incorporated data elements 
developed with input from the study’s Technical Review Panel and from NCES. Core data elements 
in the B&B:08/12 interview included such items as degree attainment, continuing or graduate 
education, employment, debt and finances, and interest in or preparation for K–12 teaching. The 
B&B:08/12 interview consisted of seven topical sections: Eligibility, Undergraduate Education, 
Postbaccalaureate Education and Training, Postbaccalaureate Employment, K–12 Teaching, Student 
Background, and Locating.  

B&B:08/12 used a single web-based instrument to conduct both self- and interviewer-

administered interviews. To minimize mode effects, or systematic differences in responses 
depending on whether the interview was completed by the respondent on the web or administered 
by an interviewer over the telephone, the instrument included several features: help text and 
telephone interviewer instructions on every form, pop-up messages when a response was entered in 
an incorrect format, and text to encourage responses to critical items (i.e., conversion text) when 
sample members did not provide a response.

respondents. Reported percentages may differ from calculations based on unrounded numbers.

Executive Summary 

A draft of the B&B:08/12 interview was field tested in 2011 to assess item wording, evaluate 

data quality, and determine the length of the interview. In addition, the field test included 
experiments designed to test both varying item layouts and the efficacy of a set of financial 
incentives for participation. Appendix C describes the development process and results of the field 
test. 

B&B:08/12 employed a data collection technique known as responsive design. Responsive 

design approaches can have many goals; for B&B:08/12, the responsive design efforts were 
intended to reduce bias in survey estimates due to nonresponse. Key elements of the B&B:08/12 
responsive design were intended to identify sample members who were most likely to contribute to 
nonresponse bias if they did not respond and to reduce nonresponse bias by increasing response 
among the identified cases. B&B:08/12 tested a responsive data collection design based on a 
multivariate distancing measure known as the Mahalanobis distance.  

Prior to the start of data collection, all sample cases were randomly assigned to control and 

treatment groups. A Mahalanobis calculation based on the multivariate distance between the baseline 
respondent average and an individual nonrespondent was calculated at three points during the 
B&B:08/12 data collection. Nonrespondents with high Mahalanobis distances were considered the 
most likely to contribute to nonresponse bias, and those in the treatment group were selected for 
targeted interventions. Cases targeted during the first intervention point received a $15 increase in 
their promised incentive. Cases targeted as part of the second intervention received a $5 prepay via 
FedEx. Cases targeted at the third, and final, intervention were offered an abbreviated interview.  
Results of the experiment showed that the $5 prepaid incentive and abbreviated interview 

offer increased response rates. However, nonresponse bias analyses did not show significant 
reductions in nonresponse bias between the treatment and control groups across sampling frame 
variables or those variables included in the Mahalanobis model. 

In the full-scale study, 14,600 (or 85 percent) of the 17,140 sample members in the 

B&B:08/12 cohort completed an interview. Of these completed interviews, 92 percent were 
completed on the web and 8 percent were completed by telephone. The interview averaged 35.3 
minutes to complete overall, with web interviews averaging 34.6 minutes and telephone interviews 
43.2 minutes. 

Administrative File Matching 

In addition to the student interview, data collection for B&B:08/12 included record 
matching to the Central Processing System (CPS), the National Student Loan Data System 
(NSLDS), and the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC). These sources provided information 
from federal financial aid applications, federal records on student loans and Pell Grants, and 
respondents’ postbaccalaureate enrollment, respectively. The CPS contains records for individuals 
who applied for federal financial aid. About 13 percent of the B&B:08/12 sample had a record in 
the CPS in the 2012–13 school year. The NSLDS includes only historical records for sample 
members who received federal loans or Pell Grants. About 13,210 study members (77 percent) 
matched to NSLDS loan records and 8,810 (51 percent) matched to NSLDS Pell Grant records. 
B&B:08/12 interview nonrespondents were matched to the NSC StudentTracker database, which 
provides information on postsecondary enrollment, degree, and certificate records on behalf of 
participating postsecondary institutions. Overall, a record match for a student’s enrollment at any 
NSC-participating institution was obtained for about 1,150 (45.5 percent) of the B&B:08/12 
nonrespondents.

Executive Summary 

Data File Processing 

Throughout data collection, data were processed, examined for quality, and edited. 

Anomalous values were investigated and resolved, where appropriate, through the use of data 
corrections and logical recodes.  

Once data collection and final editing were complete and the study respondents identified, 
B&B:08/12 data were subject to perturbation procedures to protect the confidentiality of specific 
individuals. Perturbation procedures, which have been approved by the NCES Disclosure Review 
Board, preserve the central tendency estimates but may increase nonsampling error slightly. 

Analysts derived new variables from raw data in several ways. When multiple sources of data 

were available, analysts set priorities among these sources on an item-by-item basis, reconciling 
discrepancies within and between sources as needed. Analysts also recoded, combined, or 
summarized items within and across data sources to create derived variables. Appendix H lists the 
variables derived for B&B:08/12. Details about the creation of each variable appear in the variable 
descriptions in PowerStats and codebooks for the restricted files. 

B&B staff imputed missing data for many derived variables in accordance with mass 

imputation procedures described by Krotki, Black, and Creel (2005). After replacing missing data 
where values could be deduced with certainty based upon logical relationships among observed 
variables, the weighted sequential hot deck method was used to replace the remaining missing data by 
imputing plausible values from statistically selected donor cases (Cox 1980; Iannacchione 1982). 

To reduce error due to imputation, B&B staff performed quality checks throughout 

imputation. In particular, staff compared the distributions of values before and after imputation and 
examined the raw data, as needed, to resolve apparent anomalies. Appendix G shows the item 
response and nonresponse rates among all students for each variable subject to imputation and the 
pre- and postimputation means and distributions for continuous and categorical variables, 
respectively. 

Analysis Weights and Variance Estimation 

Three weights were developed for analyzing the B&B:08/12 data. A bookend weight was 

developed for analyzing NPSAS items in combination with items directly from or derived from the 
B&B:08/12 interview. A panel weight was developed for analyzing NPSAS items in combination with 
items directly from or derived from both the B&B:08/09 interview and the B&B:08/12 interview. A 
panel transcript weight was developed for analyzing items from all three interviews and transcripts.2 All 
weights were adjusted for nonresponse and were also adjusted to Integrated Postsecondary 
Education Data System (IPEDS) and NPSAS:08 control totals. 

Two procedures for estimating the variance of survey statistics are the Taylor series 

linearization procedure and the bootstrap replication procedure. Variables used for both of these 
variance estimation procedures are available on the B&B:08/12 data files. 

B&B:08/12 data are available as restricted-use data files or as public use data via the NCES 
web tools (QuickStats and PowerStats), found at http://nces.ed.gov/datalab. The primary analysis 
file, from which PowerStats was constructed, shows data for 14,570 respondents and contains over 
2,600 variables, developed from multiple sources. 
                                                 
2 A cross-sectional weight was not included because analyses of B&B:08/12 data almost always include NPSAS:08 items, especially 
demographic characteristics.

Chapter 1.  
Overview 

This report documents the methods used in the 2008/12 Baccalaureate and Beyond 

Longitudinal Study (B&B:08/12). RTI International, with the assistance of MPR Associates, Inc.,1 
conducted B&B:08/12 for the U.S. Department of Education’s National Center for Education 
Statistics (NCES) under Contract No. ED-05-CO-0033. 

Chapter 1 of this report describes the background, legislative authorization, schedule, and 

products of B&B:08/12. Chapter 2 presents sampling details for the B&B:08 cohort. Chapter 3 
describes the development of the interview, the data collection process and results, and interview 
data quality. Chapter 4 describes administrative data collection processes and outcomes. Chapter 5 
summarizes the file preparation process for the B&B:08/12 interview. Finally, chapter 6 presents the 
weighting and variance estimation procedures. Materials used during the data collection and 
additional analysis tables are appended to the report and cited in the text where appropriate.  
Unless otherwise indicated, a criterion probability level of .05 was used for all tests of 
significance conducted for the B&B:08/12 evaluations. Throughout this publication, reported 
numbers of sample institutions and students have been rounded to protect the confidentiality of 
institutions and individuals. As a result, row and column entries in tables may not sum to their 
respective totals, and reported percentages may differ somewhat from those that would result from 
these rounded numbers. 

1.1  Background and Purpose 

NCES conducts several studies to respond to the need for a national and comprehensive 
database related to postsecondary education. These studies address issues such as access, choice, 
enrollment, persistence, attainment, continuation into graduate and professional schools, and the 
benefits of postsecondary education to individuals and to society.2 B&B is one of several studies 
sponsored by NCES to address these issues, specifically studying bachelor’s degree recipients over 
time.  
NCES is authorized to conduct B&B by the following legislation: 

• 

the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended by the Higher Education Opportunity 
Act of 2008, 20 U.S.C. § 1015(a) (2012); 
the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002, 20 U.S.C. §§ 9541 to 9548 (2012); and 
the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, 20 U.S.C. § 1070 et seq. (2012). 

• 
• 
B&B provides a longitudinal study of the education, work, financial, and personal 

experiences of individuals who have completed a bachelor’s degree at a given point in time. Three 
distinct B&B cohorts, each sampled almost a decade apart, have allowed researchers to evaluate how 
baccalaureate degree recipients have fared at differing times in recent history.  

Students were identified as bachelor’s degree recipients through the B&B base-year study, 

the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS). NPSAS is a nationally representative trend

study of postsecondary students designed to determine how students and their families pay for 
postsecondary education. The first B&B cohort was identified in 1993 as part of NPSAS:93. That 
cohort was subsequently interviewed in a B&B follow-up in 1994 (B&B:93/94), which included a 
collection of transcript data. The B&B:93 cohort was surveyed again in 1997 (B&B:93/97) and in 
2003 (B&B:93/03). A second B&B cohort began with NPSAS:2000 and involved only a 1-year 
follow-up in 2001 (B&B:2000/01). NPSAS:08 identified the third and current B&B:08 cohort. 
B&B:08/09 was conducted 1 year after the base-year NPSAS:08 data collection and included a 
transcript collection, and B&B:08/12 was conducted 4 years after the base-year study. Figure 1 
shows the data collection timelines for the base-year and subsequent follow-up studies for each B&B 
in the series.

Study (B&B:08/12). 

B&B covers a number of topics of interest to policymakers, educators, and researchers. The 

study allows for analysis of both the participation and progress of bachelor’s degree completers in 
the workforce and the relationship of degree type and focus to employment status, income, and 
ability to repay debt. The study also collects data on entry into, persistence through, and completion 
of postsecondary education, and B&B:08/12 includes an oversample of students who earned 
bachelor’s degrees in a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) field. A special 
emphasis of B&B is the examination of pathways and experiences of new elementary and secondary 
school teachers. Many issues related to teacher preparation, entry into the profession (e.g., timing 

2 

B&B:08/12 Data File Documentation 

Chapter 1. Overview 

and ease of entry), persistence in teaching, and career movement within education can be examined. 
Two B&B studies (B&B:93/94 and B&B:08/09) have collected postsecondary transcript data that 
provide a unique opportunity for analysts to review what courses students take in college and 
explore relationships between collegiate coursetaking and respondents’ postbaccalaureate 
experiences (work, graduate school, etc.).  

Although the focus and principal content of B&B interviews in each of these three cohorts 

have remained relatively consistent, expert panels and other reviews of the interviews have helped to 
shape and alter questions as needed for relevancy. The B&B:08/12 survey was revised to provide 
data related to a human capital framework (Becker 1994). B&B also gathers extensive information 
on bachelor’s degree recipients’ undergraduate experiences, demographic backgrounds, expectations 
regarding graduate study and work, and participation in community service.  

1.2  Schedule and Products 

Table 1 summarizes the schedule for the major B&B:08/12 activities. Electronically 

documented, restricted-access research files (with associated codebooks) and the NCES online 
application PowerStats have been constructed and are available for use by researchers. In addition to 
this data file documentation, B&B:08/12 has produced a First Look report that provides descriptive 
information for the B&B:08/12 cohort, special tabulations on issues of interest to the higher 
education community, and descriptive reports of significant findings for dissemination to a broad 
range of audiences. A list of many of these publications is available at 
http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/b&b/.

Chapter 2.  
Sampling Design 

Identification of the B&B:08/12 sample required a multistage process that began with 

selection of the NPSAS:08 sample of institutions and was followed by selection of students within 
these institutions. A third stage confirmed that sample members who, as of NPSAS:08, were 
expected to complete a bachelor’s degree in the 2007–08 academic year were indeed baccalaureate 
recipients during that academic year and, therefore, were eligible to be sampled for the B&B:08 
cohort. All eligible sample members (as determined by the B&B:08/09 interview and the transcripts) 
were included in the B&B:08/12 sample. 

2.1  Respondent Universe and Sample 

To be eligible for inclusion in the B&B:08 cohort, a student3 must have been a student at an 

institution included in the NPSAS:08 institution universe.  

2.1.1  Universe for B&B:08/12 

NPSAS:08 Institution universe. To be eligible for the NPSAS:08 sample, institutions had 

to meet certain criteria during the 2007–08 academic year. They must have 

•  been eligible to distribute Title IV funds; 
•  offered an educational program designed for persons who had completed at least a high 

school education; 

•  offered at least one academic, occupational, or vocational program of study lasting at 

least 3 months or 300 clock hours; 

•  offered courses that were open to persons other than the employees or members of the 

company or group (e.g., union) that administers the institution; 

•  been located in one of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, or Puerto Rico; and 
•  not been a U.S. service academy. 
Institutions that provided only vocational, recreational, or remedial courses or only in-house 
courses for their own employees were excluded. U.S. service academies were also excluded because 
of their unique funding/tuition base. 

These institution eligibility conditions were consistent with previous NPSAS administrations, 
with two exceptions. First, the criterion of being eligible to distribute Title IV aid was implemented 
beginning with NPSAS:2000,4 and second, previous NPSAS studies excluded institutions that 
offered only correspondence courses. NPSAS:08 included such institutions if they were eligible to 
distribute Title IV student aid.  

NPSAS:08 Student universe. To be eligible for NPSAS:08, students had to be enrolled in a 

NPSAS-eligible institution in any term or course of instruction at any time from July 1, 2007, 
through June 30, 2008. Students also had to meet the following requirements: 
                                                 
3 Sample members are referred to as students because they were students during the 2007–08 academic year, when the sample selection 
occurred. Many of the sample members were not students at the time of the B&B:08/12 study.  
4 An indicator of Title IV eligibility has been added to the analysis files from earlier NPSAS studies to facilitate comparable analyses.

Chapter 2. Sampling Design 

•  be enrolled in any of the following: an academic program; at least one course for credit 
that could be applied toward fulfilling the requirements for an academic degree; or an 
occupational or vocational program that required at least 3 months or 300 clock hours of 
instruction to receive a degree, certificate, or other formal award; 

•  not be currently enrolled in high school; and 
•  not be enrolled solely in a General Educational Development (GED) or other high 

school completion program. 

B&B:08 cohort. B&B:08-eligible persons were individuals who completed requirements for 

a bachelor’s degree from a NPSAS:08-eligible institution between July 1, 2007, and June 30, 2008, 
and were awarded their baccalaureate degree by the institution from which they were sampled no 
later than June 30, 2009.  

2.1.2  Sample for B&B:08/12 

NPSAS:08 Institution sample. NPSAS:08 constructed its institution sampling frame from 

the 2004–05 Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS:2004–05) Institutional 
Characteristics (IC), Fall Enrollment, and Completions files. Because the original sample of 1,630 
institutions was drawn from the IPEDS:2004–05 IC file, the institution sample was freshened in 
order to add newly eligible institutions to the sample and produce a sample that was representative 
of the institutions eligible in the 2007–08 academic year. To do this, the IPEDS:2005–06 IC, Fall 
Enrollment, and Completions files were used to create an updated sampling frame of current 
NPSAS-eligible institutions. Through this process, about 10 institutions were added to the sample. 
In fall 2007, NCES decided to include state-representative undergraduate student samples for four 
degree-granting institution sectors (public 4-year; public 2-year; private nonprofit 4-year; and for-
profit 4-year) in six states: California, Georgia, Illinois, Minnesota, New York, and Texas.5 To 
accomplish this, a supplemental sample was drawn and added to the existing sample. The final 
NPSAS:08 sample included 1,960 institutions and was selected from 46 institution strata based on 
state, institution level and control, highest level of offering, and proportion of bachelor’s degrees 
awarded in education.6 Of these 1,960 institutions,7 about 1,940 (99 percent) were eligible to 
participate in NPSAS:08. Table 2 shows the number of institutions that were sampled, the number 
of eligible institutions, and the number and unweighted and weighted percentages of eligible 
institutions providing enrollment lists, by institution characteristics. 

                                                 
5 These six states were selected based on the size of undergraduate enrollment in the four sectors; prior inclusion in the NPSAS:04 
12-state sample with high levels of cooperation and participation in that survey; and unique or recently changed tuition and state grant 
policies that provided opportunities for comparative research and analysis. 
6 The proportion of bachelor’s degrees awarded in education was used to ensure that sufficient numbers of sample students received a 
bachelor’s degree in education. Such students are an important analysis domain for B&B. 
7 Reported numbers have been rounded to ensure the confidentiality of data. As a result, reported percentages (based on unrounded 
numbers) may differ somewhat from those that would result from these rounded numbers.

NPSAS:08 Student sample. Sample institutions provided lists of their eligible students. As 
student lists were received from institutions, students were sampled by means of stratified systematic 
sampling with predetermined sampling rates that varied by student stratum. NPSAS:08 oversampled 
potential baccalaureate recipients to allow sufficient numbers to be included in the B&B follow-up 
studies and, thus, stratified them separately from other undergraduate students. Business majors 
make up a high proportion of baccalaureates; therefore, business majors were undersampled among 
potential baccalaureate recipients to ensure that the sample did not consist primarily of business 
majors. Additionally, STEM majors; National Science and Mathematics Access to Retain Talent 
(SMART) Grant recipients; and Academic Competiveness Grant (ACG) recipients were 
oversampled to allow the analysis of sufficient numbers of these analytically important subgroups. 
Further, institutions that awarded proportionally higher numbers of degrees in education majors 
were oversampled to ensure sufficient numbers for analysis. There were 20 student strata, as follows: 

1.  in-state potential baccalaureate recipients who were business majors; 
2.  out-of-state potential baccalaureate recipients who were business majors;

Unlike studies in which an eligible sample member’s response to the survey instrument 
determines whether a particular case is included in the analytic file, the NPSAS family of studies 
determine study response on the basis of the presence of data on a key subset of variables. This has 
the effect of preserving some sample members who do not respond to the survey instrument, but 
for whom robust administrative data exist. A study respondent was defined as any sample member who 
was eligible for the study and had valid data from any data source for the following variables: 

student type (undergraduate or graduate/first-professional);  

• 
•  date of birth or age;  
• 
•

baccalaureate recipients were collected with the student list of all enrolled undergraduate and 
graduate/first-professional students. However, these baccalaureate lists often could not be provided 
until late spring or summer when baccalaureate recipients could be positively identified; this 
negatively affected the data collection schedule. To encourage an earlier receipt of enrollment lists, 
4-year institutions were asked to include an indicator (B&B flag) of students who had received or 
might receive a baccalaureate degree during the NPSAS year (between July 1, 2007, and June 30, 
2008).8 Institutions were instructed to make this identification before spring graduation. Four-year 
institutions were also asked to include an indicator of class level for undergraduates (1st year, 2nd 
year, 3rd year, 4th year, or 5th year). From NPSAS:2000, it was estimated that about 55 percent of 
the 4th- and 5th-year students would be baccalaureate recipients during the NPSAS year and that 
                                                 
8 The B&B flag had values of yes, no, and don’t know.

about 7 percent of 3rd-year students would also be baccalaureate recipients. This class-level indicator 
was used when the B&B flag was not provided for any students.  

Because most enrollment lists were received before June 30, 2007, and many were received 

before April, some sample students identified by the institution as baccalaureate candidates were 
determined during the NPSAS interview not to be baccalaureate recipients (false positives). Likewise, 
some sample students not identified by the institution as baccalaureate candidates were determined 
during the NPSAS interview to have received baccalaureate degrees (false negatives) during the 
specified time frame. See the 2007–08 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:08) Full-scale 
Methodology Report for additional details on the NPSAS:08 sampling (Cominole et al. 2010). 

B&B:08/09 sample. The sample for B&B:08/09 included 25,050 NPSAS:08 sample 

members who had been identified as potentially eligible for membership in the B&B:08 cohort. In 
the first follow-up, eligibility for the B&B:08 cohort was based primarily on information obtained 
from the student’s transcript. For students who lacked a transcript, eligibility was based on responses 
provided during the NPSAS:08 student interview. For students without either a transcript or a 
NPSAS:08 interview, eligibility was based on institution records or the enrollment list provided by 
the NPSAS:08 institution at the time of student sampling. Table 4 shows the distribution of the 
25,050 NPSAS:08 sample members by the sources of information used to determine their eligibility. 
Table 5 shows the final eligibility status, based on transcripts, of the 18,000 B&B:08 sample 
members whose baccalaureate receipt was confirmed in the NPSAS:08 interview.

In addition to transcripts being collected from the sampled institutions for NPSAS:08 

interview respondents, they were requested for the 7,050 NPSAS:08 interview nonrespondents who 
were either confirmed in student records9 to be degree candidates or listed by the NPSAS:08 sample 
institution as bachelor’s degree candidates. Approximately 5,150 NPSAS:08 nonrespondents were 
determined to be eligible or eligibility could not be determined for B&B:08/09 based on transcript

data. In order to have full population coverage of the B&B:08/09 sample, a subsample of 500 of the 
5,150 NPSAS:08 nonrespondents was selected for inclusion in the first follow-up. To maximize the 
eligibility rate among the subsample, the 5,150 NPSAS:08 nonrespondents were stratified based on 
study respondent, transcript, National Student Clearinghouse (NSC), and student record statuses. 
The NSC data on degree completion were used to identify eligible students but could not identify 
ineligible students with certainty. Within each stratum, the nonrespondents were first sorted by 
institution sector to ensure the representativeness of the sample and were also sorted by the 
NPSAS:08 sampling weight within sector. Then the sample was drawn within each stratum with 
probabilities proportional to the NPSAS:08 sampling weight. The sampling rates used in each 
stratum were different in order to maximize response and eligibility rates while also representing the 
various types of sample members. The B&B:08/09 sample was not designed to be representative at 
the state level. Table 6 shows the distribution of the potential baccalaureate recipients without a 
NPSAS:08 interview and the subsample.

There were three types of respondents in B&B:08/12, each corresponding to one of the 

three analysis weights created for use in this survey. A bookend respondent was defined as any 
NPSAS:08 study respondent who had a completed, partial, or abbreviated B&B:08/12 interview. A 
panel respondent refers to any NPSAS:08 study respondent who had a completed, partial, or 
abbreviated interview for both B&B:08/09 and B&B:08/12. A transcript panel respondent was a panel 
respondent who also had a transcript provided by the NPSAS:08 institution.  

Table 9 shows the number of students sampled, the number of eligible students, and the 

unweighted and weighted response rates, by institution control, for the bookend, panel, and 
transcript panel respondents. The weighted bookend response rate was 77 percent; the weighted 
panel response rate was 68 percent; and the weighted transcript panel response rate was 64 percent.

Chapter 3.  
Interview Design, Data Collection, 
Outcomes, and Evaluation 

The B&B:08/12 interview was designed for web and telephone administration. Sample 

members were primarily located using address and phone sources and were asked to complete the 
interview between August 2012 and April 2013. Analyses and evaluation of data from an interview 
field test as well as from previous full-scale B&B studies provided information for consideration 
when planning B&B:08/12. 

3.1 

Interview Design and Systems  
The B&B:08/12 interview consisted of seven sections, grouped by topic. It also offered an 

abbreviated interview that consisted of selected questions from all sections. This section of the 
chapter provides the details of the interview design and systems. 

3.1.1  Interview Design 

As the second follow-up survey of 2007–08 college graduates, the B&B:08/12 interview was 

designed to collect and update postsecondary enrollment and employment information, as well as 
key demographic information. The interview design incorporated longstanding questions created for 
the B&B:93 and B&B:2000 cohorts and the B&B:08/09 interview, in addition to new and revised 
items developed with input from the study’s Technical Review Panel (TRP) and NCES that were 
tested in the B&B:08/12 field test. For a list of TRP members, see appendix A; for a list of the final 
set of interview data elements, see appendix B.  

Design of the full-scale interview began with a review of items asked in the field test and 
methodological analyses from the field test, such as interview timing, item nonresponse, and help 
text analysis (see appendix C for the field test facsimile and methodological analysis). This review 
identified items needing clarification or simplification and items to be included in cognitive testing.  

The cognitive testing process elicited respondent feedback to broad themes including 

question terminology and relevance. Recruited respondents represented three groups of particular 
interest: those enrolled in postbaccalaureate education, those who graduated with a bachelor’s degree 
in a STEM field, and those who had prepared for or were interested in teaching at the K–12 level. 
Twenty-nine cognitive interviews were completed during three rounds of cognitive testing that took 
place between October 2011 and February 2012. Project staff monitored cognitive interviews 
through in-person observation and audio recording. Respondent feedback was reviewed by the 
B&B:08/12 TRP and NCES and used to refine interview items for the full-scale interview.  

The B&B:08/12 full-scale interview consisted of seven sections, grouped by topic (figure 2). 

Respondents were guided through each section of the interview according to skip logic that took 
into account information recorded as the respondent progressed through the interview.

Study (B&B:08/12). 

 

The following are descriptions of the seven interview sections:  

1.  Eligibility. This section determined interview eligibility for any sample member for whom 

eligibility status had not yet been determined. Eligible sample members completed bachelor’s 
degree requirements at their NPSAS institution between July 1, 2007, and June 30, 2008, and 
were awarded the degree by June 30, 2009. To allow for interview routing for subsequent 
items, respondents were asked to report on their current marital status, whether they shared 
financial responsibilities with anyone, and household composition. Respondents who failed 
to meet eligibility requirements were asked to provide contact information so that project 
staff could review their eligibility status. After review, project staff recontacted any eligible 
respondents.  

2.  Undergraduate Education. The undergraduate education section was administered only to 

B&B:08/09 nonrespondents. This section collected the names of all colleges, universities, or 
trade schools attended by respondents prior to receiving a bachelor’s degree from the 
NPSAS institution. For each institution, respondents were asked to provide dates of 
attendance and enrollment intensity. Respondents who reported attending multiple 

16 

B&B:08/12 Data File Documentation 

Chapter 3. Interview Design, Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

undergraduate institutions were asked questions about transferring credits to the NPSAS 
institution. Finally, respondents were asked whether they were satisfied with their choice of 
major and the quality of education obtained from the NPSAS institution. 

3.  Postbaccalaureate Education/Training. This section of the interview gathered information from 
respondents about any postsecondary enrollment since earning their bachelor’s degree. If 
respondents attended any schools after receiving a bachelor’s degree from the NPSAS 
school, they were asked to provide school name(s), type of enrollment (degree or otherwise), 
field(s) of study, enrollment intensity, degree(s) earned, reasons for attendance, and any 
financial aid received. Respondents who had not enrolled since receiving a bachelor’s degree 
were asked about their intentions for future enrollment, including whether they had taken a 
graduate or professional school entrance exam, planned field of study, expected enrollment 
intensity, and financial assistance. Students who reported receiving education loans were 
asked for additional information on the repayment status, loan amounts, and monthly 
payments for those loans. 

4.  Postbaccalaureate Employment. In the employment section, respondents were asked about all 
paid employment since receiving their bachelor’s degree. Those who had been employed 
were asked a series of questions about each of their employers, including name, employment 
dates, job title and duties, earnings, and hours worked per week for the starting and ending 
jobs with that employer. Respondents were also asked additional items for up to three 
employers. These items include employer type, industry, benefits, relation of job to 
bachelor’s degree, and job satisfaction. Respondents were also asked about job searches 
since graduating with a bachelor’s degree and activities while not working.  

5.  Kindergarten–12th Grade (K–12) Teaching. All respondents were asked about their teaching 

experience and interest. Respondents who were not currently teaching but had prepared to 
teach or had considered teaching were asked to discuss any applications for teaching jobs or 
reasons why they had not applied to be teachers. The bulk of the section included questions 
for current K–12 teachers only. These questions included teacher certification type; content 
area certifications; teaching positions held; number and name(s) of primary and secondary 
schools where they had worked since graduating with a bachelor’s degree; grades and 
subjects taught; perceived level of preparation for teaching; experiences as a K–12 teacher; 
earnings; hours worked per week; level of job satisfaction; plans for staying in teaching and 
for moving into other education-related positions; and awareness of teacher loan forgiveness 
programs. 

6.  Student Background. In this section, respondents were asked to provide demographic 

information (e.g., citizenship, military status, and number and age of any dependents). A set 
of financial items asked about their income and expenses, including mortgage, car, and 
student loans, and saving for retirement.  

7.  Locating. This section of the interview collected contact information to be used for potential 

follow-up studies. 
B&B project staff developed an abbreviated interview that included a subset of key items 

from each section. The abbreviated interview was used as a treatment in the responsive design 
experiment described in section 3.4.7 and as a final offer to remaining nonrespondents at the end of 
data collection.  

B&B:08/12 Data File Documentation

Chapter 3. Interview Design, Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

Interview administration. Project staff developed a single mixed-mode instrument to be 

administered via web and telephone. For telephone interviews, the interviewer accessed the web 
instrument through RTI’s Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing Case Management System 
(CATI-CMS), which prioritized cases and provided the appropriate screens and scripts to read 
during CATI.  

Interview features. The B&B:08/12 instrument was designed to minimize differences in 
presentation across modes to the extent possible. For example, the self-administered web survey 
included features that replicated the guidance and support that a telephone interviewer would 
provide. To ensure that high-quality data were obtained, and to make the interview process as 
efficient as possible across the mixed-mode presentation, key features of the mixed-mode design 
included the following:  

•  question wording that worked in both aural and visual presentations; 
•  on-screen instructions for telephone interviewers that helped ensure proper and 
consistent oral administration of the various types of questions (e.g., whether the 
response options were to be read aloud); 

•  help text on every form in the interview to standardize terms and clarify question 

meaning (help text results are discussed in section 3.5.2); 
conversion text to encourage responses to critical items when these items were left 
unanswered (conversion text results are discussed in section 3.5.4); and 

• 

•  pop-up messages to clarify any inconsistent, out-of-range, or improperly formatted 

values entered by respondents. 

Mock scenarios were used to rigorously test the skip logic, question wording, screen layout, 
and overall efficiency of the instrument. Testing was conducted from a variety of internet browsers, 
using a range of internet connection options, and at various times of day. The instrument 
development process was facilitated by the use of RTI’s Hatteras system (described in detail in 
section 3.1.2). The use of Hatteras allowed project staff to coordinate testing efforts with NCES and 
communicate necessary changes. 

Coding systems. Assisted coding systems (coders) were used to standardize the collection 

and classification of postsecondary institutions, major or field of study at postbaccalaureate 
institutions, occupations, and K–12 schools. Respondents or telephone interviewers entered text 
strings, then matched their entry with options returned from a keyword search linked to an 
underlying database of standardized terms. The following are descriptions of the individual coding 
systems and sources: 

•  The postsecondary institution coder was created from the set of institutions contained in the 
2011 IPEDS, developed by NCES (http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/). The IPEDS database 
contains all Title IV eligible institutions in the United States and its territories. For any 
institutions not listed in the database, respondents were asked to provide the control 
(e.g., public or private) and level (e.g., 2-year or 4-year) of the institution.  

•  The major coder was constructed using the 2010 Classification of Instructional Programs 
taxonomy, developed by NCES (http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cip2010). For any majors or 
fields of study not listed in the database, respondents were asked to provide a general 
major area and a specific discipline.  

18

Chapter 3. Interview Design, Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

•  The occupation coder was built from the 2010 Occupational Information Network Online 

(O*NET OnLine) database (http://online.onetcenter.org). For any occupations not 
listed in the database, respondents were asked to provide a general area, a specific area, 
and finally, a detailed classification area for the occupation. 

•  The elementary and secondary school coder (El/Sec Coder) was used to code any elementary or 
secondary schools where respondents taught. NCES data sources used for schools in the 
El/Sec Coder were the 2007–10 Private School Universe Survey for private schools 
(http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pss/) and the 2009–12 Common Core of Data for public 
schools (http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/). Respondents were asked to indicate whether the 
school was public or private and to provide the city and state where it was located. The 
El/Sec Coder then displayed a list of possible schools, and the respondent was asked to 
select the correct school from the list. If the right school was not found in any of the 
data sources, the entered text string was retained, and respondents were asked to supply 
the control (e.g., public or private) of the school; the names of the school’s district, 
county, or both; and the highest and lowest grade levels offered at the school.  

3.1.2  Data Collection Systems 

The B&B:08/12 full-scale study employed several systems to collectively develop, 
implement, and support instrumentation and processes for data collection and reporting. 

Hatteras Survey Engine and Survey Editor. The web survey instrument was developed 

using Hatteras, a web-based system in which project staff developed, reviewed, tested, modified, and 
communicated changes to specifications and code for the instrument. All information relating to the 
instrument was stored in a SQL Server database and was made accessible through web browser 
interfaces. Hatteras interfaces and tools included the following: 

•  Specifications. Hatteras provided the tools and user interface for developing interview 

specifications. Specification content included wording at the form, question, item, and 
response option levels; help text content; item-level data documentation; and form-level 
question administration documentation. Capabilities of the Hatteras system allowed 
instrument designers to import any relevant specifications used in prior studies, create 
skip logic and item documentation, and search a library of survey items. Instrument 
designers were also able to take advantage of a comprehensive comment tracking system 
to communicate instrument changes and testing results with programmers.  
A web interface provided access for project staff at remote locations and NCES staff to 
test and comment on the instrument throughout its development.  

•  Programming code. For simple instrument questions and items, Hatteras automatically 

translated specifications into program code. For questions involving complex routing, 
multiple question wording or response option conditions, or nonstandard page layout or 
behavior, programmers entered custom programming code—HTML, JavaScript, and 
C#.NET script—into the Hatteras custom code interface. This code was stored in the 
SQL Server database, together with the instrument specifications for compilation by the 
survey execution engine. 
Instrument testing and execution. Hatteras allowed immediate testing of specification and 
code content via a web URL. Based on the specifications and custom code, the survey 
execution engine automatically handled such web instrument functions as backing up

Chapter 3. Interview Design, Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

and moving forward, recording instrument timing data, displaying critical-item wording, 
validating user input, displaying conditional instructions based on interview mode (web, 
telephone, or field), and linking to context-specific help text. 

•  Survey sites and data transfer—web/telephone. For web and telephone data collection, the 

Hatteras system was installed on the NCES surveys web servers and SQL Server 
database. Web respondents accessed the survey directly by web browser after logging in 
with a user ID and password or by following a supplied direct-login link. RTI’s 
telephone interviewers accessed the same NCES web survey site by means of a web 
browser process launched from the CATI-CMS (described below). All connections to 
the NCES web interview were secured with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. 
Automated processes transferred data between the NCES database and RTI’s database 
via a secure, encrypted connection. RTI’s database was housed in an Enhanced Security 
Network (ESN), a separate storage network that was certified to meet the standards 
required for protection of data classified as National Institute of Standards and 
Technology moderate. User access to the ESN is restricted by two-factor login security. 

The systems used to support the B&B:08/12 full-scale data collection included the 

Integrated Management System (IMS), the Receipt Control System (RCS), CATI-CMS, and the 
intensive Tracing Operations System (TOPS). 

IMS. All aspects of the study were monitored using the IMS, a project management tool 

designed to give project staff and clients ready access to a repository of reports, critical project 
information, and deliverables. Daily reports and management information from all the major 
systems across the study resided in the IMS, accessible via the web, and protected by SSL encryption 
and a password-protected login. The IMS contained the current project schedule; monthly progress 
reports; daily data collection reports and status reports (generated by RCS); project plans and 
specifications; project deliverables; instrument specifications; a link to the instrumentation system; 
staff contacts; the project bibliography; and a document archive. 

RCS. RCS refers to the control system database and its integrated set of applications used to 
control and monitor all activities related to data collection, including tracing and locating. Through 
the control system applications (bundled under the name Symphony), project staff were able to 
perform such activities as e-mailing groups of sample members, preparing lead letters and follow-up 
mailings, sending cases for batch tracing, reviewing locating information, tracking case statuses, and 
viewing comments from telephone interviewers. The control system was fully integrated with both 
the CATI system and TOPS, such that all systems accessed sample member data from a single 
database. Case status changes in the interview, CATI, or TOPS systems automatically triggered 
updates to the RCS during overnight processes, providing seamless integration among the data 
collection systems as well as the ability to identify problems early and implement solutions 
effectively.  

CATI-CMS. The CATI-CMS scheduled telephone calls to be made by telephone 

interviewers and tracked call outcomes. Cases who could not be located were set to a need tracing 
status, which made them available immediately for TOPS. Quality control supervisors and project 
managers used the CATI-CMS to manage cases based on factors such as call frequency, call 
outcomes, and institution sector. Managers could also re-assign cases or put cases on hold and 
review them as necessary. Within the CATI-CMS, telephone interviewers had the ability to send a 
reminder username/password e-mail to callers who wished to self-complete the interview. All data 
captured by telephone interviewers were entered via the CATI-CMS into the control system 

20 

B&B:08/12 Data File Documentation 

Chapter 3. Interview Design, Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

database in the ESN. These data were thus immediately accessible to TOPS and other control 
system utilities (such as e-mail and postcard reminder generation applications). 

TOPS. During data collection, TOPS allowed tracers to work with cases for whom CATI 
operators had been unable to locate the sample members. TOPS enabled tracers to review all of a 
case’s data, including comments left by telephone interviewers in CATI and use various search 
methods to attempt to find current contact information. When TOPS found new locating data, the 
data were stored in the RCS, where the data became immediately available to control system utilities 
for reminder e-mails and letters, as well as to CATI for immediate call scheduling. If a tracer in 
TOPS located a sample member via telephone, the call was switched to a CATI operator for 
immediate interviewing. TOPS supervisors were able to manage the tracer’s loads and review cases 
as needed. 

3.2  Data Collection 

B&B:08/12 student data collection included a single web-based interview in two modes: self-

administered web and telephone. The data collection effort included training for telephone 
interviewers and supervisors; tracing and locating sample members; mail, e-mail, and telephone 
prompting; and refusal conversion. Telephone interviewing, help desk, and tracing activities were 
conducted by RTI’s Call Center Services (CCS) group, housed in the Research Operations Center. 
Telephone interviewers assisted sample members who needed assistance with a password, or had 
questions about the interview, or who called in to complete the interview by phone. The 
interviewers also made outbound calls to sample members, prompting them to complete the 
interview by phone or web. The procedures are detailed in this section. 

3.2.1  Study Website and Help Desk  

B&B:08/12 sample members were provided with a link to the study website in all mail and 
e-mail communications and were referred to the website to obtain information about the study. The 
website provided detailed information about the study, including the study sponsor, answers to 
frequently asked questions (FAQs), information on confidentiality and data security procedures, 
findings from previous studies, links to the NCES and RTI websites, and contact information for 
the data collection staff. Sample members used their login credentials to access the secure website 
and complete the interview. Figure 3 shows the home page for the B&B:08/12 study website.

SOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 2008/12 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal 
Study (B&B:08/12). 

 

The study website was designed in compliance with NCES web policies, which incorporate a 

three-tier security approach to protect all data. The first tier requires a secure login, including a 
unique study ID and strong password provided to sample members. The second tier protects any 
information entered on the website with SSL technology, which transmits only encrypted data. The 
third tier of security requires collected data to be stored on a secured SQL Server database that is 
physically separate from the web server.  

The B&B:08/12 help desk opened in conjunction with the start of data collection. A toll-free 

help desk number was established and staffed 7 days a week during the day and evening. Help desk 
staff were trained to answer questions about the study, provide technical support, and conduct 
telephone interviews. The help desk is further described in section 3.2.4. 

3.2.2  Locating, Tracing, and Contacting Sample Members  

B&B:08/12 used a multistep approach to locating, tracing, and contacting sample members, 

in which the most cost-effective steps were taken first to minimize the number of cases who 
required more expensive tracing efforts (figure 4). Prior to the start of data collection, database 
searches and contact information update mailings were conducted. Throughout data collection, 
follow-up locating methods were employed, including CATI locating and additional tracing. Sample 

22 

B&B:08/12 Data File Documentation 

Chapter 3. Interview Design, Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

members who were not successfully located in batch tracing were sent to TOPS, as described in 
section 3.1.

Study (B&B:08/12).  

Batch tracing. Batch database searches were conducted to update sample member contact 

information prior to the start of data collection. These searches were conducted for all sample 
members with information sufficient for matching (such as sample member name and Social 
Security number [SSN]), regardless of whether they already had contact information on file. The 
database searches used for B&B:08/12 were as follows:  

•  The Central Processing System (CPS) contains locating information for students who have 
applied for financial aid using the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).  
•  The National Change of Address Database (NCOA) contains 160 million change-of-address 

records submitted to the U.S. Postal Service. Data are maintained for 4 years and 
updated weekly.  

•  Lexis Nexis (formerly FirstData) Phone Append offers a residential telephone number search 

of over 170 million listings, including 6 million listings for recent relocates. Phone 
Append returns a telephone number based on a search by name, street address, and ZIP 
code.  

B&B:08/12 Data File Documentation 

23 

Chapter 3. Interview Design, Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

The information obtained from these sources was merged with the information previously 
available from the NPSAS:08 and B&B:08/09 locator databases. An additional batch search using 
Lexis Nexis Premium Phone was conducted during data collection for cases in which all existing 
numbers resulted in no contact with the sample member. Premium Phone searches over 475 million 
landline, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), and wireless numbers in the United States, Puerto 
Rico, and Canada.  

Initial contact mailings. In July 2012, about 2 weeks before the start of the B&B:08/12 
data collection, an initial contact mailing was sent to sample members and their parents to request 
up-to-date contact information. This mailing included a study brochure, a letter with detailed 
information about B&B:08/12 signed by the associate commissioner of NCES, a contact 
information update sheet, a business reply envelope, and instructions for updating information 
online. If either the sample member or parent updated or confirmed contact information, sample 
members were sent a $10 check.  

Data collection mailings. At the start of data collection on August 21, 2012, sample 

members were sent a data collection announcement mailing and e-mail. The mailing included a study 
brochure and a letter that announced the start of data collection. The letter, signed by both the B&B 
project director and the NCES project officer, informed sample members of the incentive for 
completing the interview, provided the study website and login credentials for accessing the web 
interview, and provided the study’s toll-free help desk number and e-mail address. The e-mail 
included equivalent information, along with a direct link to the interview. Additional reminders were 
sent periodically to nonrespondents throughout data collection, including reminder e-mails, 
postcards, and letters sent in FedEx packages. (See appendix D for data collection materials.) 

CATI locating. In addition to interviewing and prompting sample members to complete 

the interview, telephone interviewers helped locate sample members. When making outbound calls, 
the telephone interviewers attempted to gather locating information from parents or other contacts 
who answered the call. Interviewers then followed up on the leads generated by those contact 
attempts. If this approach was not successful, the interviewer used other information—such as 
previous study call records—available for the sample member and other contacts to try to locate the 
sample member. When the interviewer had exhausted all tracing leads available, the case was sent to 
intensive tracing.  

TOPS. Cases who could not be located by other methods were sent to TOPS. These 

included cases who did not have a telephone number to load into the CATI-CMS at the start of data 
collection and cases for whom all known numbers resulted in a dead end during initial data collection 
efforts. Intensive tracing was divided into two tiers: TOPS-1 and TOPS-2. 

The first tier (TOPS-1) searched for sample members in consumer databases by matching 
SSNs. Database batch searches included LexisNexis, Experian, and Accurint. If this search resulted 
in a new telephone lead, the case was immediately returned to CATI for follow-up by telephone 
interviewers, minimizing the time that cases were unavailable for outbound dialing. If the search 
resulted in a new address only, tracers used directory assistance searches to locate a telephone 
number for the contact.  

In the second tier (TOPS-2), tracers searched for additional sample member information or 
other contacts that could provide a potential lead to the sample member. Tracing staff conducted a 
thorough review of each case and determined the appropriate next steps based on the leads 
developed from prior tracing and contacting activities. Tracers utilized consumer databases, such as 

24 

B&B:08/12 Data File Documentation 

Chapter 3. Interview Design, Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

those used in TOPS-1, but targeted their search based on data from other sources. All cases not 
located during TOPS-1 were sent to TOPS-2.  

Once located, cases were contacted and asked to complete the interview. Cases who could 

not be located after exhausting all leads were finalized as unlocatable. 

3.2.3  Training of Data Collection Staff  

The B&B:08/12 interview data collection team included telephone interviewers, quality 

control supervisors, quality experts, and intensive tracing staff, all of whom completed a 
comprehensive training program prior to beginning work on the study (table 10). Prior to project-
specific training, all interview data collection staff completed a general training session, which 
covered call center procedures, the CATI-CMS, confidentiality procedures and sample member 
rights, and conversational interviewing techniques. The project-specific training sessions included 
instruction on the B&B:08/12 study and its purpose, case management procedures, frequently asked 
questions, and interactive activities designed to maximize active trainee participation (see appendix E 
for training materials).

Telephone interviewers. The telephone interviewers were the primary point of contact 

with sample members. Their responsibilities included responding to sample member questions and 
concerns about the study, providing technical assistance for logging in to the web interview, gaining 
cooperation, averting and/or converting refusals, and conducting telephone interviews. The 
B&B:08/12 interviewers each had a minimum of several months’ experience working on other large-
scale education studies. The prior training that telephone interviewers attended included 
introductions to and practice in the CATI-CMS and Case Tools. Case Tools is an application that 
interviewing staff use to track help desk calls and e-mail sample members’ survey credentials. The 
telephone interviewers received an additional 8-hour training program prior to beginning work on 
B&B:08/12. The training covered an overview of B&B:08/12, a review of the survey instrument 
including training and practice specific to each coder, mock interviews, guidance on providing 
technical support to sample members, and instruction on conversational interviewing techniques.  

Training materials included a telephone interviewer manual, conversational interviewing 

guidelines, and frequently asked questions. Upon completion of the training, telephone interviewers 
were certified by completing a mock telephone interview and providing appropriate and accurate 
responses to frequently asked questions.  

Quality control supervisors. Quality control supervisors monitored telephone interviewer 
performance and production, provided guidance to interviewers, and helped troubleshoot problems. 
Quality control supervisors attended the interviewer project training and received additional 
guidance on case review, problem resolution, project-specific reports, and other procedures specific 
to B&B:08/12.  

B&B:08/12 Data File Documentation 

25 

Chapter 3. Interview Design, Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

Quality experts. Quality experts monitored interviewer performance via the Quality 
Evaluation System to ensure that the data collected met the highest possible quality standards. 
During each session, quality experts used special audiovisual stations to silently observe a percentage 
of all calls made by B&B interviewers. Quality experts attended interviewer project training and met 
regularly with project staff throughout data collection to discuss interviewing protocols and their 
concerns. 

Tracing staff. Tracing staff responsibilities are described in section 3.2.2. Tracers completed 
a 16-hour training program on general tracing techniques, led by tracing managers within RTI’s CCS. 
Tracers also completed two additional hours of project-specific training, including an overview of 
B&B:08/12, review of frequently asked questions, and tracing techniques most appropriate for 
locating B&B:08/12 sample members. 

Additional training. Concepts from training sessions were reinforced in bi-weekly quality 

circle meetings, which provided a forum for brief trainings on specific topics, such as case 
management techniques, updates to project procedures, or strategies for administering complex 
interview forms. Telephone interviewers were also encouraged to ask questions, which helped 
identify needs for training topics for subsequent quality circle meetings. Selected staff received 
additional trainings on specific topics, including refusal conversion techniques. Telephone 
interviewers, quality control supervisors, and quality experts all received a booklet outlining best 
practices in managing cases and administering the B&B instrument. 

3.2.4  Interviewing  

B&B:08/12 interviews were conducted between August 21, 2012, and April 15, 2013. Data 
collection for the B&B:08/12 interview consisted of two phases: the early response phase, during which 
sample members were invited to complete the web interview, and the production phase, during which 
sample members were prompted to complete either the web or telephone interview with regular 
outbound phone calls, mailings, and e-mails (figure 5). This approach allowed the most responsive 
cases to complete the interview before beginning more expensive outbound prompting efforts.  

Figure 5.  Data collection phases: 2012

Study (B&B:08/12). 

 

26 

B&B:08/12 Data File Documentation 

Chapter 3. Interview Design, Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

Early response phase. This phase began in August 2012 and lasted approximately 4 weeks. 

Sample members were invited by mail and e-mail to complete the interview on the web. A small 
team of telephone interviewers were available to assist inbound callers, but no outbound prompting 
calls were made during the early response phase. Sample members who completed the interview 
were eligible to receive varying incentive amounts, depending on their predicted response propensity 
(see section 3.4.7).  

Production phase. During the production phase, telephone interviewers called sample 

members to encourage them to complete the interview either online or over the telephone. Sample 
members were also sent several mail and e-mail reminders to complete the interview. Most sample 
members who completed the interview during the production phase were eligible to receive the 
same incentive offered during the early response phase; however, some sample members’ incentive 
offers increased throughout the data collection, as described in section 3.4.7.  

Both the web and telephone versions of the interview were available to sample members 
throughout data collection, although the web interview was encouraged during the early response 
period.  

Web interview. All mail and e-mail reminders sent to sample members included the URL 

and the sample member’s unique login credentials for accessing the web interview. The web 
interview was available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week throughout the entire data collection.  

Telephone interview. Telephone interviewers began outbound calling on September 27, 
2012, approximately 4 weeks after the start of data collection. Telephone interviewers were tasked 
with attempting to locate sample members, gaining their cooperation, providing technical assistance, 
and conducting interviews.  

Cases were assigned to interviewers by the CATI-CMS automated call scheduler, which 
assigned cases to interviewers by case type and priority, best day and time to call, and scheduled 
appointment times. The scheduler organized cases into queues based on a variety of factors, 
including the results of prior contact attempts, refusal status, and any appointments set. The CATI-
CMS scheduler also automatically prioritized telephone numbers to call by which lines were most 
likely to result in reaching the sample member. New numbers were continuously added to the 
scheduler based on tracing efforts, updates received through mailings and e-mails, or leads from help 
desk call-ins and CATI locating efforts. The CATI scheduler reprioritized telephone numbers based 
on new information.  

Help desk. Throughout data collection, telephone interviewers and quality control 

supervisors also answered calls to the toll-free help desk number. They were trained to assist sample 
members with a variety of issues, such as verifying the sample member’s identity, looking up web 
interview login information for the sample member, immediately sending login credentials to sample 
members by e-mail, scheduling text message reminders, and updating the sample members’ contact 
information. Because the help desk was staffed by telephone interviewers and supervisors, the help 
desk staff were also able to immediately conduct the telephone interview with inbound callers. 
Help desk staff logged each call, recording a description of the issue and its resolution. 

During B&B:08/12, the help desk responded to 511 inbound calls and 92 voicemail messages—86 
in English and 6 in Spanish. The most common types of help desk calls included requests for more 
information about the study, information on incentive checks not yet received, and requests to 
retrieve login credentials. To reduce the need for telephone assistance, the B&B:08/12 website 

B&B:08/12 Data File Documentation 

27 

Chapter 3. Interview Design, Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

featured a Need your study ID or Password? link that allowed sample members to retrieve their own 
password or study ID immediately. 

3.3  Data Collection Quality Control 

A number of quality control procedures were implemented throughout the B&B:08/12 

interview data collection. These procedures included frequent monitoring of telephone interviews, a 
help desk that tracked and resolved difficulties encountered by sample members attempting to 
complete the web interview, quality circle feedback meetings, and help desk agent and interviewer 
debriefings at the conclusion of the study. 

3.3.1  Interview Monitoring 

Regular monitoring of telephone interviews during B&B:08/12 data collection was 

conducted to meet the following data quality objectives:  

• 
• 

identification of problem items in the interview; 
improvement in interviewer performance through reinforcement of effective 
interviewing strategies; 
reduction in the number of interviewer errors; and 
assessment of the quality of the data collected. 

• 
• 
Quality experts and project staff monitored live and recorded interviews throughout data 

collection, using remote monitoring telephones and computer equipment. They recorded 
observations on standardized monitoring forms that covered such topics as interviewer 
professionalism, question administration, and knowledge of the instrument. After each monitoring 
session, interviewers received feedback based on observations from the session. Issues identified 
during monitoring were frequently incorporated into quality circle meetings to improve the quality 
of telephone interviews. Segments of recorded interviews were also employed as training aids during 
project trainings and quality circle meetings.  

3.3.2  Quality Circle Meetings 

Quality circle meetings were held regularly throughout data collection to maintain strong 

communication between data collection staff and telephone interviewers, to communicate the goals 
and progress of the study, and to address challenges encountered along the way. These meetings 
provided staff with the opportunity to discuss the survey instrument, to share sample member 
cooperation strategies, to motivate staff toward response rate goals, and to obtain insight on various 
data collection issues. Quality circle meeting topics included 

review and discussion of interview questions, response options, and help text;  

•  updates on data collection and overall study progress;  
• 
•  guidance on interviewing techniques (such as active listening); 
•  guidance on strategies for gaining cooperation from sample members and other contacts 

and general refusal conversion and aversion techniques;  

•  data security protocols; and  
•  guidance on case review activities.  

28 

B&B:08/12 Data File Documentation 

Chapter 3. Interview Design, Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

After each quality circle meeting, data collection staff prepared a detailed newsletter 
summarizing the meeting discussion. The newsletter included updated counts of interview 
responses, answers to interviewers’ questions, discussion of issues specific to the interview 
instrument, and special topics. All interviewing, tracing, and supervisory staff were required to read 
the newsletter.  

3.3.3  Debriefing 

At the end of data collection, telephone interviewers completed a debriefing questionnaire 

and participated in group debriefing meetings to discuss the information provided in the 
questionnaire. Questionnaire topics included training and communication, the interview instrument, 
the CATI-CMS and case management systems, and the techniques and tools for locating and 
contacting sample members. The results obtained from the debriefing questionnaire were discussed 
and successes and areas for improvement in project training and data collection were identified. For 
example, telephone interviewers suggested improving the training module on managing inbound 
calls and using more challenging practice interview scenarios in training. They also reported that the 
tools and support they received throughout data collection helped them to overcome the challenges 
associated with gaining cooperation from sample members. A debriefing report was prepared to 
summarize results of the debriefing and document considerations for planning future studies.  

3.4  Data Collection Outcomes 

This section provides the results of the B&B:08/12 interview data collection. Details of the 

overall interview response rate of 85 percent are included, as is a description of the success of 
various locating methods. A timing analysis shows that the interview, on average, took about 35 
minutes to complete.  

3.4.1  Student Locating Results 

Overall locating and response rates for B&B:08/12 varied by several factors, including the 
response status in the two prior studies and the NPSAS:08 base-year institution type. Located and 
response rate results, by first follow-up interview response status and institution type, are shown in 
table 11.

1 Through the course of data collection, approximately 20 sample members were found to be deceased. The deceased cases have 
been excluded from the final eligible sample (17,110) but are included in this analysis of data collection results. 
2 Sample members were counted as “located” if they were ever located at some point during data collection.  
3 Interviewed count includes eligible sample members who met the criteria for qualification as an interview respondent, which 
required completing at least a partial interview. 
NOTE: Percentages were unweighted. Detail may not sum to total because of rounding.

First follow-up (B&B:08/09) interview respondents were more likely than B&B:08/09 

interview nonrespondents to be located and to complete the second follow-up (B&B:08/12) 
interview. B&B:08/09 respondents had a located rate of 98 percent in B&B:08/12, compared with 
only 87 percent for B&B:08/09 nonrespondents (χ2 = 646.26, p < .001). Ninety percent of all 
B&B:08/09 respondents completed B&B:08/12, compared with only 53 percent of B&B:08/09 
nonrespondents (χ2 = 1976.51, p < .001). 

Located rates for B&B:08/12 ranged from 94 percent (for sample members from for-profit 

2-year or more institutions) to 100 percent (for those from public 2-year institutions). Response 
rates ranged from 81 percent (for sample members from for-profit 2-year or more institutions) to 
100 percent (for those from private nonprofit 2-year or less institutions).  

Located rates by source of locating data. Contact information for the B&B:08/12 sample 

was obtained and confirmed by matching with various sources of locating data. This process 
successfully confirmed contact information or provided new contact information for 32,240 records 
(36 percent). Prior to data collection, the sample was matched with CPS, NCOA, Phone Append, 
FAFSA, and the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS). Premium Phone and the SSN 
Search were used only as needed for cases who required additional tracing efforts. Depending on the 
source, a matched record could have been a new or confirmed address, e-mail, or phone number. 
Locating results by tracing source are shown in table 12.

Located rates by contact information update. B&B:08/12 sample members (or their 

parents) were asked to update their contact information prior to the start of data collection. Address 
update requests promised a $10 check incentive for updated information. Contact information 
updates were received from 7,180 sample members (42 percent) in response to the initial contact 
letter mailing and e-mail. If an update was received through the web or through the form sent to 
parents, the sample member was located during data collection almost 100 percent of the time and 
interviewed almost 100 percent of the time (table 13).

Completed interviews by mode of administration. B&B:08/12 interviews were 

completed by web or by telephone. Most of the interviews—about 9,440 (65 percent)—were 
completed by web without telephone contact; 3,960 (27 percent) were completed by web with 
telephone contact; and 1,200 (8 percent) were completed by telephone (figure 6).

Completed interviews by data collection phase. The B&B:08/12 data collection design 

consisted of two operational phases. The early response phase included the first 4 weeks of data 
collection during which there were no outbound calling activities. The majority (56 percent) of 
B&B:08/12 interviews were completed during the early response phase (table 17). The remaining 44 
percent were completed during the production phase, which comprised the remainder of the study 
and was marked by the start of outbound calling. The early response phase of data collection yielded 
a 48 percent response rate, with 8,150 completed interviews out of 17,140 cases. The next phase of 
data collection, the production phase, yielded a 70 percent response rate, with 6,300 completed 
interviews out of the remaining 8,990 cases.

3.4.3  Interview Timing Burden 

To assess the burden associated with completing the B&B:08/12 interview, the time 

required for each respondent to complete the full-scale interview was collected and analyzed. Special 
attention was paid to differences by mode, items with consistently high administration times, and the 
time required to navigate particular interview paths.  

To record the time it took to complete the interview, whether administered online or by 

telephone, a time stamp was embedded on each web screen, or form, of the interview. A start timer 
recorded the clock time on a respondent’s or interviewer’s computer when a form was first loaded, 
and an end timer recorded the clock time when the Next button was clicked. For each form 
administered to a respondent, time was calculated by subtracting the start time from the end time. 
Total instrument time was calculated by summing the times recorded for all forms. Only cases who 
completed the entire interview in a single session were included in the analysis. Outliers, defined as 
form response times exceeding 2 standard deviations from the interview-level mean, were also 
excluded. 

Overall, respondents took an average of 35.3 minutes to complete the B&B:08/12 interview 

(table 18). Web interviews averaged 34.6 minutes, while telephone interviews took significantly 
longer, at 43.2 minutes (t(1,023) = 20.94, p < .001).10 Telephone interviews required more time than 
web interviews for all sections, and all differences were significant: Eligibility (t(1,080) = 20.38, 
p < .001); Undergraduate Education (t(639) = 2.73, p < .01); Postbaccalaureate Education 
(t(10,028) = 6.83, p < .001); Postbaccalaureate Employment (t(10,028) = 11.58, p < .001); Teaching 
(t(914) = 6.09, p < .001); Background (t(1,177) = 16.88, p < .001); Locating (t(10,028) = 18.67, 
p < .001). 

                                                 
10 The Satterthwaite (1946) degrees of freedom approximation was used in tests with unequal variances.

Interview time by path. The path respondents had followed to complete the B&B:08/12 

interview varied by whether respondents had been enrolled in a degree or certificate program, 
whether they had any postbaccalaureate employment, and whether they had taught since receiving a 
bachelor’s degree. It also varied by their previous interview response status.  

Depending on their prior study response status, some respondents were asked questions 

related to study eligibility and undergraduate experiences to capture information that had been 
collected in earlier interviews. NPSAS:08 nonrespondents completed the interview in an average of 
36.5 minutes, while NPSAS:08 respondents took an average of 35.3 minutes (table 19). B&B:08/09 
nonrespondents completed the interview in an average of 37.9 minutes, while B&B:08/09 
respondents took an average of 35.1 minutes.

In the Postbaccalaureate Education section, respondents were asked about any additional 

postsecondary attendance since their last interview. The questions in this section covered both 
degree and certificate programs as well as nondegree coursework. Respondents who had not 
attended a postsecondary institution as part of a postbaccalaureate degree program or for nondegree 
coursework were asked about any plans for future enrollment. Respondents who had attended as 
part of a postbaccalaureate degree or certificate program took an average of 9.4 minutes to complete

the section, while respondents who had not attended as part of a postbaccalaureate degree or 
certificate program since the last interview took an average of 3.5 minutes (table 20). Respondents 
who were not currently attending to obtain a postbaccalaureate degree or certificate but planned to 
attend in the 2012–13 school year took an average of 2.7 minutes to complete the section.

The Postbaccalaureate Employment section focused on the job(s) that respondents held in 

the years after completing a bachelor’s degree. This section collected information regarding all 
periods of employment and unemployment since graduation, focusing on job duties, earnings, 
benefits, job satisfaction, and job search activities. On average, the Postbaccalaureate Employment 
section took 15.2 minutes to complete (table 21). Respondents who had been employed since 
completing their bachelor’s degree (about 97 percent) spent 15.6 minutes on the Postbaccalaureate 
Employment section. Those who had no employment to report spent 1.3 minutes. Respondents 
who reported only one job took 10.2 minutes to complete, those with two or three jobs required an 
average of 17.9 minutes, and respondents with four or more jobs took 25.1 minutes to complete the 
section.

The Teaching section collected information about the respondent’s experiences with, or 
interest in, teaching at the Kindergarten through 12th-grade level (K–12). The K–12 Teaching 
section took an average of 1.6 minutes to complete (table 22). Respondents who had never been a 
teacher and were not planning or preparing to become one took an average of 30 seconds to 
complete the section. Respondents who were current or former teachers and those who were either 
considering or preparing to teach took 4.3 minutes. The latter group can be divided among current

B&B:08/12 interview, the current occupation coder (B12DOCC01) had the highest average 
observed administration time at 1.5 minutes. The time required to complete the occupation coder 
(and other coders in the interview) was expected, given that coders required the respondent or 
telephone interviewer to (1) enter text strings on the form; (2) hit Enter to conduct a keyword search 
on an underlying database; and (3) select a response from the returned list of possible matches. 

Forms requiring respondents to provide specific details about their job (including starting 

and ending job title, salary, hours per week, and full-time vs. part-time status [B12DEMPLOY201]), 
and about their employer (including employer name and location [B12DEMPLOY01]), also had 
relatively high administration times, at 63.3 seconds and 40.3 seconds, respectively.  

A calendar-style form that collected months of employment after completing a bachelor’s 
degree through the present month (B12DWKMON01) also had high administration times. This 
form requested information from previous years, which required respondents to take time to recall 
information going back as far as July 2007 and record the responses.  

Forms that collected several pieces of information on the same screen by utilizing a radio 

button grid also had high administration times (B12CFINAIDG01, B12CFACS, and 
B12ETHNKINFL). These forms required additional response time because respondents provided 
answers to several questions on one screen (table 23).

Timing of abbreviated interview. The abbreviated version of the B&B:08/12 interview 

included the Eligibility section and key questions from the other sections of the interview. Only 
cases who completed the entire abbreviated interview in a single session were included in the timing 
analysis. Outliers, defined as form response times exceeding 2 standard deviations from the 
interview-level mean, were also excluded. 

On average, the abbreviated interview took 20.2 minutes (table 24). Overall, web interviews 

took 19.8 minutes and were significantly shorter than telephone interviews, at 23.1 minutes 
(t(87) = 3.74, p < .001 ). Respondents spent the most time on the Postbaccalaureate Employment 
section of the abbreviated interview, as was the case with the full interview. Telephone interviews 
required more time than web interviews for all sections, and the following sections had significantly 
longer average interview lengths for telephone interviews: Eligibility (t(117) = 2.56, p < .05); 
Teaching (t(653) = 5.49, p < .001); Background (t(200) = 7.78, p < .001); and Locating 
(t(653) = 5.31, p < .001).

3.4.4  Telephone Interviewer Hours 

B&B:08/12 telephone interviewers logged about 5,827 hours, with 897 telephone interviews 

completed. An average of 7 calls were made to each case overall, with prior round respondents 
receiving an average of 14 calls per case. Telephone interviewer hours were spent on interviewing 
and case management activities, which included locating and contacting sample members, 
prompting sample members to complete interviews, reviewing case events from current as well as 
prior data collections with this cohort, scheduling appointments for callbacks, recording events in 
the case management system, and responding to incoming calls to the help desk.  

3.4.5  Number of Calls to Sample Members 

The average number of calls placed per sample member varied by B&B:08/12 interview 

response status, prior round (B&B: 08/09) response status, and interview mode (web or telephone). 
B&B:08/09 interview respondents received an average of 6 calls per case, compared with 14 calls 
per case for B&B:08/09 nonrespondents (t(2,493) = 32.19, p < 0.001).  

B&B:08/12 respondents required an average of 5 calls per case, with web respondents 

requiring an average of 4 calls and telephone respondents requiring an average of 11 calls (table 25). 
However, when excluding web respondents who required no calls (such as cases completed during 
the early response phase), web respondents required an average of 14 calls, 3 more calls on average 
than their telephone interview counterparts (t(2,036) = 9.3, p < .001). Sample members who did not 
respond or were ultimately excluded or determined ineligible for the B&B:08/12 interview received 
an average of 20 calls per case.

3.4.6  Refusal Conversion 

Strategies for converting and averting refusals were integrated into the telephone interviewer 
training activities and were reinforced in quality circle meetings throughout data collection. In quality 
circle meetings, telephone interviewers and project staff often discussed the most effective strategies 
for gaining and maintaining cooperation from sample members as well as the best practices for 
averting and converting refusals. Sample members who refused to participate were assigned to a 
special queue and handled only by interviewers who received specialized training on refusal 
conversion techniques. A total of 7 percent of all eligible cases ever refused; 33 percent of those 
cases eventually completed an interview (table 26).

3.4.7  Responsive Design Experiment 

B&B:08/12 tested a responsive data collection design based on a multivariate distancing 

measure known as Mahalanobis distance. A key requirement of a responsive data collection design was 
the ability to identify nonrespondents who were most likely to contribute to nonresponse bias. The 
likelihood for nonresponse bias can then be reduced by increasing response among the identified 
cases. The Mahalanobis distance value measures the extent to which a nonrespondent differs from 
the average across the respondents and therefore assists in identifying target cases.  

A Mahalanobis calculation based on the multivariate distance between the baseline 

respondent average and an individual nonrespondent was calculated at several points during the 
B&B:08/12 data collection. The calculation was based on the following covariates that were known 
or imputed for both respondents and nonrespondents: 

race/ethnicity; 
age; 

• 
• 
•  parents’ education; 
•  marital status; 
• 
•  disability; 
•  Carnegie code; 

immigrant generational status;

expected family contribution; 

• 
•  baccalaureate field of study; 
• 
• 
•  SAT score; 
• 
• 
•  grade point average; and 
• 
Prior to the start of data collection, all sample cases were randomly assigned to control and 
treatment groups. Treatment group cases with a high Mahalanobis value were targeted during data 
collection at three points in time. At each of the three points: 

earned income; 
employment history; 

time to receive bachelor’s degree. 

•  Mahalanobis values were evaluated for all remaining nonrespondents; 
• 

a cut point was determined to distinguish low- and high-distance cases based on the 
Mahalanobis distribution and sample size; 
cases were assigned to low- and high-distance groups on the basis of the cut point; and 
treatment cases within the high-distance group were eligible for interventions as defined 
below. 

• 
• 

Phase 1 – additional incentive. The first 3 months of data collection included web data 
collection and CATI-light, which involved a minimal number of phone calls, mainly to prompt web 
response. After the first 3 months, Mahalanobis values were evaluated for the remaining 
nonrespondents, and treatment cases above the cut point were offered a $15 incentive in addition to 
their original of $20, $35, or $55. Once a case became eligible for the additional $15, it remained 
eligible for that amount even if it moved into the low-distance group later.  

Phase 2 – $5 prepay incentive via FedEx. After an additional month of data collection (4 

months overall), Mahalanobis values were evaluated again for the remaining nonrespondents, and 
those treatment cases above the new cut point received a $5 prepay incentive via FedEx.  

Phase 3 – abbreviated interview. After an additional 2 months of data collection (6 

months overall), Mahalanobis values were evaluated again for the remaining nonrespondents, and 
those treatment cases above the cut point were offered an early abbreviated interview. The 
experiment was closed 2 weeks before the end of data collection, and at that time all remaining 
nonrespondents were offered an abbreviated interview. 

Several questions were used to outline the analytical framework for the full-scale experiment. 

The questions and the results of the related analyses are described below. 

Were response rates improved among high-distance cases with the use of increased incentive amounts, a 
$5 prepay via FedEx, and earlier abbreviated interviews?  
Response rates were examined for the high-distance control and treatment groups to 
determine whether the overall response rates for the treatment and control groups differ 
significantly. While the goal of this approach was to minimize bias—and not necessarily 

42 

B&B:08/12 Data File Documentation 

Chapter 3. Interview Design, Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

to increase response rates—a higher response rate among the treatment group was a 
necessary requirement for a reduction in bias. Table 27 shows the number of 
respondents and nonrespondents, the weighted response rate, and whether the 
difference between the treatment group and the control group was significant.  
The weighted response rates for the treatment group were significantly higher than those 
for the control group during Phase 2 (13 percent vs. 5 percent) and Phase 3 (10 percent 
vs. 5 percent), which accounted for an overall significant difference during all three 
phases (30 percent vs. 21 percent).

Chapter 3. Interview Design, Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

Did outcome measures differ for high- and low-distance cases?  
The Mahalanobis distance measure was used to identify cases believed to be important in 
terms of bias reduction. One way to assess the effectiveness of this approach was to 
compare outcomes between high- and low-distance cases to determine whether they 
were in fact different. A significant difference in outcome measures between high- and 
low-distance cases would indicate that the Mahalanobis model, which used the proxy 
variables described earlier in this section, correctly identified cases who were different 
from each other. Two types of outcome measures were assessed: (1) outcomes based on 
survey responses (available only for survey respondents) and (2) outcomes based on 
administrative data (available for the entire sample).  
Among the survey-based outcome measures (using the bookend weight), there was a 
significant difference between high- and low-distance respondents for 9 out of 16 
interview outcome measures (table 28). For survey respondents, high-distance cases held 
more jobs but spent more time unemployed since earning a bachelor’s degree than low-
distance cases. High-distance cases were older when they received their bachelor’s degree 
and were more likely to have dependent children than low-distance cases.  
Outcomes available for the entire sample included indicators of postbaccalaureate 
enrollment from NSC and federal financial aid information from the NSLDS. There 
were no significant differences between high- and low-distance sample members for 
federal aid estimates (table 29), but high-distance sample members were less likely than 
low-distance sample members to have enrolled in another postsecondary program or 
attained another postsecondary degree since their 2007–08 bachelor’s degree.

Was nonresponse bias reduced by targeting and converting high-distance cases?  
The effect of the responsive design approach on unit nonresponse bias was measured by 
comparing nonresponse bias estimates for the treatment group with nonresponse bias 
estimates for the control groups. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in unit 
nonresponse bias between respondents assigned to the treatment group—including 
high- and low-distance cases—and respondents assigned to the control group—
including high- and low-distance cases.  
Nonresponse bias was estimated and tested to determine if bias was significant at the 
p < .05 level for the variables in the Mahalanobis model listed earlier in this section and 
for the following frame variables:  
− 
− 
− 
−  Pell Grant receipt (yes/no); 
−  Pell Grant amount (categorical); 
−  Stafford Loan receipt (yes/no); 
−  Stafford Loan amount (categorical); 
−  Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS); 
− 
federal aid receipt (yes/no); 
− 
institution aid receipt (yes/no); 
−  state aid receipt (yes/no); and 
−  any aid receipt (yes/no). 
The mean and median absolute bias were computed across the categories of these 
variables. Results showed that the mean absolute bias was not significantly different 
between the treatment group and the control group for any comparisons, indicating that 
the inclusion of the treated high-distance cases did not significantly reduce nonresponse 
bias. This result may have been due to the homogeneous population and the relatively 
high response rate. However, the percentage of variable categories that was significantly 
biased was lower in the treatment group than in the control group (table 30). For 
example, using the bookend weight with frame and Mahalanobis model variables, the 
control group had significant bias in 31 of 65 variables tested (48 percent). In 
comparison, the treatment group had 18 of 66 variables with significant bias (27 
percent). This suggests that, while the overall measure of bias—mean absolute bias—was 
not significantly different between the treatment and control groups, bias may have been 
reduced for some individual variables.

3.5  Evaluation of Interview Data Quality 

Evaluation of the B&B:08/12 interview items included analyses of the data collected in the 
instrument coders and a review of help text access rates, success rates for conversion text, and item 
nonresponse. 

3.5.1  Instrument Coding Systems 

Assisted coding systems were used to standardize data collection and code postsecondary 

schools attended, majors or fields of studies, occupations, and any elementary or secondary schools 
where the respondent may have taught. Text strings were collected from the respondent, and then a 
keyword search of an underlying database was conducted, allowing the respondent to select the best 
option from a list of possible options returned. For a description of each coder, see section 3.1.1.  
Recoding. Ten percent of the major and occupation codes chosen in the interviews were 

randomly selected for recoding, a process in which expert coding staff reviewed codes. To review data 
and provide information for improving instrument coders in future studies, expert coding staff 
assessed the accuracy of codes chosen in the interview based on the text string provided by the 

48 

B&B:08/12 Data File Documentation 

Chapter 3. Interview Design, Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

respondent. Across modes of administration and coders, expert coding staff generally agreed with 
the codes chosen for text strings in the interview. Overall, expert coding staff agreed with major and 
occupation codes chosen in the interview 93 percent of the time and agreed with recoded codes 
chosen to a new value about 4 percent of the time. They were unable to choose a code due to vague 
text strings about 2 percent of the time. 

Neither the major nor occupation coder showed significant differences in recode rates 

between modes of administration. The rate of recoded values—same as original code, recoded to 
different value, or text string too vague to code—chosen by the expert coding staff for the major 
and occupation coders in the interview are shown in table 31.

Upcoding. In a process known as upcoding, project staff chose an appropriate code for any 

text strings provided by respondents or interviewers for which a code was not selected in the 
postsecondary, high school, major or field of study, and occupation coders. Text strings from web 
interviews generally required more upcoding than text strings from telephone interviews because 
interviewers received special training on coders.  

The major and occupation coders showed significant differences in upcoding rates between 
modes of administration. The upcoding rate among web interviews (6 percent) was higher than that 
for telephone interviews (2 percent) (χ2(1, N = 8,426)= 16.36, p < .001) for the major coder 
(table 32). Three percent of web interviews required upcoding, compared with 1 percent of 
telephone interviews (χ2(1, N = 24,114) = 46.82, p < .001) for the occupation coder.

3.5.2  Help Text Use 

Question-specific help was provided on each B&B:08/12 interview screen. The question-

specific help provided definitions of key terms and phrases used in the question wording and 
response options and provided any other explanations thought to help clarify and standardize the 
meaning of questions for respondents.

Chapter 3. Interview Design, Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

The number of times that respondents accessed help text for the first time on each screen 
relative to the number of respondents who were administered the question determined the rate of 
help text access for that screen.12 The screen-level rate of help text access was analyzed overall and 
by mode of interview administration to identify questions that may have been problematic for 
respondents. The overall mean rate of help text hits per screen was less than 1 percent on forms 
administered to at least 50 respondents. The mean rate of help text hits per screen was significantly 
higher for telephone interviews compared with web interviews, with rates of approximately 3 
percent and less than 1 percent, respectively (χ2(1, N = 881,642) = 3,818.26, p < 0.05). 

Twelve interview questions administered to at least 50 respondents had an overall help text 
access rate of 2 percent or greater (table 33). The interview question asking Aware of TEACH Grant 
Program (B12ETCHGRT) had the highest observed overall rate, at approximately 7 percent, and did 
not differ by mode of administration (χ2(1, N = 1,785) = 1.00, p = 0.32). The interview question 
with the second highest observed overall rate asked respondents to report their Current activity since 
not employed (B12DEMPOTH); this interview question had an overall rate of approximately 6 percent 
and did not differ by mode of administration (χ2(1, N = 1,169) = 2.19, p = 0.14).

Four interview questions with 2 percent or greater overall rates of help text access showed 
significantly higher rates of access during telephone interviews than during web interviews. These 
questions include the following: Able to complete bachelor’s degree without 2-year college (B12BNP2YR) 
(x2(1, N = 299) = 21.54, p < 0.001); Had vocational or technical certificate or industry certification or 
occupational license (B12CLICFILT) (x2(1, N = 13,641) = 317.0, p < 0.001); Private student loan interest rate 
                                                 
12 Partial interview respondents and abbreviated interview completions were excluded from this analysis.

Chapter 3. Interview Design, Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

(B12CPRIVRT) (x2(1, N = 2,424) = 20.69, p < 0.001); and Retirement account types (B12FRETIR) 
(x2(1, N = 13,641) = 224.21, p < 0.001).  

The help text was accessible on every question through a help text button; however, some 
questions also offered an additional hyperlink within the question or response option text to allow 
access to the help text (figure 7). Whether accessed through the help button or through the 
hyperlink, respondents and interviewers saw the same help text that provided definitions and 
explanations to clarify and standardize the meaning of questions. Help text hyperlinks were only 
available on strategically selected questions that had potentially complex or unfamiliar terms. On 
some questions, the hyperlink appeared in question wording; while in other questions, the help text 
appeared in response option wording. (For more information on the impact of hyperlinked item text 
on help text use, see the field test help text experiment in appendix C.)

SOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 2008/12 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal 
Study (B&B:08/12). 

The method through which respondents accessed help text was analyzed to identify the 

impact of help text hyperlinks. Because interviewers received training on help text use, this analysis 
included only web respondents. The data were further restricted to items that provided both a help 
button and a help text hyperlink, and interview questions that had an overall help text access rate of 
at least 2 percent overall.  

Of the 56 interview questions that provided both a help text button and hyperlink for 
respondents to access help text, only nine of these questions had a help text access of at least 2 
percent overall. Eight of the nine questions showed significantly higher rates of help text access 
through the help text hyperlink than through the help text button, and one showed no difference 
between the methods of help text access (table 34).

The question with the highest observed rate of help text access via a help text hyperlink was 

Estimated amount of private student loans (B12CPRIVEST). Every web respondent who accessed help 
text on this question used the hyperlink available on the question wording alternative or private loans. 
The item Total amount borrowed in private student loans (B12CPRIVAMT) also provided a hyperlink on 
the question wording alternative or private loans; it showed a significantly higher rate of help text access 
through the hyperlink 84 percent of the time vs. the help text button, with a 16 percent rate of 
access (x2(1, N = 275) = 129.89, p < 0.001). Five other questions provided a help text hyperlink 
within question wording and showed a significant difference between hyperlink and button access 
rates: Shares financial responsibilities with household adult (B12AFINCON) (x2(1, N = 216) = 156.74, 
p < 0.001); Postbaccalaureate school 1: average hours worked while attending (B12CENEMP01) 
(x2(1, N = 136) = 92.24, p < 0.001); Job 1: start of career (B12DCURL01) (x2(1, N = 221) = 154.86, 
p < 0.001); Aware of teacher loan forgiveness programs (B12ELNFRGV) (x2(1, N = 62) = 58.06, 
p < 0.001); and Aware of TEACH Grant Program (B12ETCHGRT) (x2(1, N = 118) = 114.03, 
p < 0.001). For these questions, respondents used the hyperlink to access help text from 91 to 99 
percent of the time.  

Finally, two questions provided the help text hyperlink in the response option wording. A 
question asking about respondent’s Retirement account types (B12FRETIR) (x2(1, N = 350) = 307.38, 
p < 0.001) and the item Had vocational or technical certificate or industry certification or occupational license 
(B12CLICFILT) (x2(1, N = 389) = 327.63, p < 0.001) provided help text hyperlinks on each 
available response option. Of respondents who accessed help text, approximately 95 percent used 
one of the available hyperlinks to access help text on each of these questions.

3.5.3  Item-Level Nonresponse 

The rate of nonresponse was used to identify troublesome interview items and to better 
understand the experiences of sample members in completing the interview. Total nonresponse 
rates were calculated for items with missing data (including don’t know responses) that were 
administered to at least 100 respondents. Overall, the item-level nonresponse analysis yielded 38 out 
of 602 interview items with more than 15 percent missing data.13 

The interview items with the overall highest observed nonresponse rates were Estimated 

federal student loan monthly payment (B12CELNMEST), Estimated private student loan interest rate 
(B12CPRIVREST), and Job 1: level of education industry (B12DEDIND01). The two estimate items 
(B12CELNMEST and B12CPRIVREST) appeared only to respondents who earlier refused to 
provide a response to an original question and may explain the high nonresponse on these items. Of 
the 140 respondents who received the estimate item Estimated federal student loan monthly payment 
(B12CELNMEST), approximately 79 percent did not provide a response. Likewise, of the 234 
respondents who received the estimate item Estimated private student loan interest rate 
(B12CPRIVREST), approximately 59 percent either answered don’t know or refused to provide a 
response. Approximately 1,604 respondents saw the item Job 1: level of education industry 
(B12DEDIND01), of whom 61 percent provided no response.  

Twenty-five of the 38 interview items with nonresponse rates of 15 percent or greater were 
presented in groups as matrix questions. The number of items presented in each matrix varied. One 
matrix question displayed nine items including an other category and collected information on 
postbaccalaureate school 1 aid type. All matrix questions presented items except the other category and 
yielded levels of nonresponse that ranged from 17 to 48 percent. In addition, two other matrix 
questions collected information on current activity since not employed and activity while not working. These 
item sets displayed five and six items, respectively, and yielded nonresponse rates ranging from 18 to 
29 percent.  

Item-level nonresponse rates were also examined by mode of administration. There were 

significant differences in nonresponse rates between the web and telephone modes for 26 of the 38 
interview items with more than 15 percent of data missing. All 26 items had a higher rate of 
nonresponse among web interviews.  

The item-level nonresponses for items administered to at least 100 respondents with a rate 
of more than 15 percent of data missing are summarized in table 35. The table also identifies item-
level nonresponse differences between the web and telephone interview modes. 

                                                 
13 Partial interview completions, missing data for interview nonrespondents, and items not available for public review (e.g., 
respondent contact information) were excluded from this analysis. For the interview items that had potentially multiple loops, this 
analysis evaluated the first loop only.

3.5.4  Conversion Text 

Eleven questions in the interview were considered critical—responses to these questions were 

especially important to the study. When respondents did not provide an answer to these questions 
and they clicked the Next button on the interview screen, the question was redisplayed with conversion 
text explaining the importance of that particular question to the study and emphasizing the 
confidential nature of responses. The text was displayed in both web and telephone modes. In 
telephone mode, telephone interviewers were asked to read the conversion text to respondents and 
then to reread the interview question. Once the conversion text was triggered, some critical 
questions also displayed a don’t know response option in the event the respondent could not reliably 
answer.  

A response conversion rate was calculated by dividing the total number of responses to the 

critical questions after the conversion text was displayed by the total number of cases where the 
conversion text was triggered. The conversion rates for the 11 critical items by mode of 
administration are shown in table 36.

Eighty-six percent of nonresponses to the critical items were converted to responses after 

the conversion text was displayed. Web interviews accounted for 880 of the 1,020 cases where 
conversion text was triggered and for 800 of the 880 converted cases. Telephone interviews 
accounted for the remaining cases where conversion text was triggered; approximately 70 of these 
cases were converted. Critical items administered on the web were converted at a significantly higher 
rate than the telephone conversion rate (88 percent vs. 70 percent) (x2(1, N = 1,018) = 36.95, 
p < .001). 

56 

B&B:08/12 Data File Documentation 

Chapter 3. Interview Design, Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

Conversion text was triggered more than 100 times for two interview questions. Respondent’s 
income in 2011 (B12FINCOM) triggered conversion text in 470 cases and yielded a conversion rate of 
90 percent with no significant difference in mode of administration. Monthly rent or mortgage payment 
amount (B12FMTGAMT) triggered conversion text in 170 cases and produced a conversion rate of 
69 percent. Web interviews for this item were converted at a rate of 77 percent, compared with 
telephone interviews that were converted at a rate of 30 percent (x2(1, N = 170) = 25.58, p < .001).  

3.5.5  Summary of Interview Design and Data Collection Findings  

B&B:08/12 full-scale interviews were conducted from August 2012 through April 2013. Of 

the 17,160 sample members, 14,600 (or 85 percent) successfully completed a full or abbreviated 
interview or were considered to be final partial interviews completed through the grid loop of the 
Employment section (160 final partial interviews). Successful locating methods included matches 
with locating data sources such as Telematch and CPS and address update information provided by 
both sample members and parents of sample members. Overall, only about 5 percent of the 
B&B:08/12 sample required intensive tracing. Attempts to increase participation during B&B:08/12 
data collection included text message reminders, paper mailout reminders, and frequent e-mail 
contacts.  

Fifty-six percent (8,150 cases) of the surveys were completed in the early response phase 

(begun in August 2012 and lasting approximately 4 weeks) and 44 percent (6,300 cases) were 
completed in the production phase. Ninety-two percent of interviews were completed by web and 8 
percent of interviews were completed by telephone. Sixty-five percent of completed web interviews 
required no telephone contact to encourage participation. Eighty-nine percent of first follow-up 
respondents completed the B&B:08/12 interview, compared with 51 percent of first follow-up 
nonrespondents.  

The B&B:08/12 full-scale study included a data collection experiment that utilized a 

monetary incentive structure that ranged from $20 to $70 and was based on results of an experiment 
conducted in the field test. Sample members who completed the interview received $20, $35, $50, 
$55, or $70 based on the predicted likelihood of a respondent’s participation and his or her status in 
the responsive design experiment. The full-scale experiment was designed to evaluate RTI’s ability to 
decrease nonresponse bias by identifying a nonrespondent’s likelihood of contributing to bias 
should he or she remain a nonrespondent. This experiment had several key steps: identify those 
cases who were least like the current nonrespondents; offer targeted cases additional incentives or 
other treatment to increase their response propensities; and evaluate the impacts of the intervention. 
Utilizing the responsive design methodology, at three points throughout the data collection, 
individuals who were most likely to contribute to nonresponse bias were identified and offered 
higher monetary incentives or alternative data collection efforts.  

The responsive design experiment produced mixed results. Results of the experiment 

showed that the $5 prepaid incentive and the abbreviated interview offer increased response rates. 
Some outcome measures differed for high- and low-distance cases and between treatment and 
control groups, but nonresponse bias analyses did not show significant reductions in nonresponse 
bias between the treatment and control groups across sampling frame variables or variables included 
in the Mahalanobis model. Although overall nonresponse bias was not reduced by targeting and 
converting high-distance cases, there were fewer variable categories with significant bias in the 
treatment group than in the control group.

Chapter 3. Interview Design, Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

The B&B:08/12 interview was based in part on core data elements used in previous B&B 
interviews and was tested prior to data collection through cognitive interviewing. On average, the 
survey took 35.3 minutes to complete. Overall, web interviews were significantly shorter (34.6 
minutes) than telephone interviews (42.6 minutes). The time required to complete the interview 
varied by the respondent’s status as a K–12 teacher, whether the respondent had participated in 
additional education, and the number of jobs held after obtaining a bachelor’s degree. Teachers 
(current, former, and those who prepared for or were interested in teaching) had a longer path 
through the interview, requiring, on average, 39.2 minutes to complete it. Those who had continued 
their education after receiving a bachelor’s degree took an average of 37.0 minutes to complete the 
interview. Those who held four or more jobs took an average of 45.5 minutes to complete the 
interview, compared with 30.1 minutes for those with only one job. The abbreviated interview, 
administered to 730 respondents, took 20.6 minutes, on average. 

Evaluation of the quality of the data provided by the B&B:08/12 survey showed that 

methodological features built into the instrument, such as the design of assisted coding systems, 
conversion text, and help text aided in the successful administration of the interview. Ninety-three 
percent of the codes selected by the respondent or interviewer matched the codes selected by expert 
coders. Eighty-six percent of the cases where conversion text was triggered in the interview were 
converted to a response. Help text on individual interview screens was accessed less than 1 percent 
of the time. The item-level nonresponse analysis yielded 38 out of 602 interview items with more 
than 15 percent of data missing.  

Debriefing of interviewers at the end of data collection indicated that frequent monitoring of 

telephone interviewers, quality circle training, and feedback meetings were all useful as data 
collection quality control procedures. Most telephone interviewers indicated that they had all the 
tools necessary to successfully administer the B&B:08/12 survey and provided recommendations for 
future training topics, particularly focusing on gaining sample member cooperation to complete 
interviews.

Chapter 4.  
Administrative Data Sources 

The data files for B&B:08/12 contain student-level data collected from administrative 

databases, interviews, and transcripts. These data are available to users in two ways. For restricted 
data licensees, a set of fully documented restricted research files are available on a CD from NCES. 
For any user, tables and regression analyses can be run through the public NCES online application 
PowerStats, via the DataLab site at http://nces.ed.gov/datalab/index.aspx. PowerStats also contains 
variable documentation. This chapter describes the administrative databases used and details the 
record matching processes applied to each. 

4.1  Overview of Data Sources 

In addition to the interview, data collection for B&B:08/12 included record matching to the 

Central Processing System (CPS), the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS), and the 
National Student Clearinghouse (NSC). This section provides a discussion of the observed match 
rates for these databases. 

4.1.1  Central Processing System 

The CPS files contain data provided to the U.S. Department of Education by students and 

their families when they complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Successful 
record matching to CPS occurred only for sample members who were federal student financial aid 
applicants for the years requested. Matching for B&B:08/12 was to CPS data for the 2010–11, 
2011–12, and 2012–13 financial aid years, using a sample member’s SSN concatenated with the first 
two letters of the last name to form the CPS ID. The percentage of sample members who matched 
to CPS for the 2010–11 academic year was about 23 percent (table 37). The rate was approximately 
19 percent for 2011–12 and about 13 percent for 2012–13. This decrease in match rates year-over-
year was expected, as fewer members of this cohort continue to be enrolled in postsecondary 
education and to apply for federal aid.

4.1.2  National Student Loan Data System 

At the request of the U.S. Department of Education, the NSLDS contractor performed 
NSLDS matching using names, SSNs, and dates of birth provided by RTI. Successful NSLDS 
matching could occur only for sample members who were awarded federal loans or Pell Grants. 
NSLDS files are historical, so information about a student’s receipt of such loans and grants was 

B&B:08/12 Data File Documentation

Chapter 4. Administrative Data Sources 

available not only for the current academic year but also for any applicable prior years. 
Consequently, historical match rates reported for B&B:08/12 sample members do not necessarily 
reflect just the match rates for the 2012–13 academic year. The federal loan match rate was about 77 
percent, and the Pell Grant match rate was about 51 percent (table 38).

4.1.3  National Student Clearinghouse 

In addition to the CPS and NSLDS file matching, the B&B:08/12 interview nonrespondents 

were matched to the NSC StudentTracker database, which provides information on postsecondary 
enrollment, degree, and certificate records on behalf of participating postsecondary institutions. In 
order to perform the match, RTI supplied the NSC with SSNs, names, and dates of birth for sample 
members who were interview nonrespondents. Overall, a record match for a student’s enrollment at 
any NSC-participating institution was obtained for about 45.5 percent of the B&B:08/12 
nonrespondents. Match results shown in table 39 were based on enrollment and degree records 
from all participating institutions for the 2007–08 academic year through the 2012–13 academic year.

Chapter 5.  
Data File Processing and Preparation 

As described in chapter 4, the B&B:08/12 data files contain individual-level data collected 

from interviews and administrative databases. These files are available as restricted research files for 
restricted-use licensees or as publically available data through PowerStats. This chapter describes the 
main study data files and details the editing and data preparation process. 

5.1  Main Study Data Files 

The primary analysis file, from which PowerStats was constructed, contains data for 14,570 

respondents. The primary analysis file contains over 2,600 variables, developed from multiple 
sources. Throughout the data collection period, data were processed and examined for quality 
control purposes. Editing of student data began shortly after the start of web data collection, when 
procedures and programs for this purpose were first developed. Anomalous values were investigated 
and resolved, where appropriate, through the use of data corrections and logical recodes. Interim 
files were delivered to NCES for review throughout the data collection period. 

Complete data for B&B:08/12 are located in the restricted-access files and were documented 

by detailed codebooks. The restricted files are available to researchers who have applied for and 
received authorization from NCES to access the restricted-data use files. Researchers may obtain 
authorization by contacting the NCES Data Security Office. The restricted-use B&B:08/12 files are

The web-based Instrument Development and Documentation System (IDADS) module of 
the Integrated Management System (see section 3.1.2) contains the finalized version of all interview 
items, their question wording, and variable and value labels, most of which were imported directly 
from the interview development system, Hatteras. B&B staff used IDADS for compiling all 
documentation for the interview. Also included were the more technical descriptions of items such 
as variable types (alpha or numeric), respondents to whom the item applied, and frequency 
distributions for response categories based on completed interview data. B&B staff used the IDADS 
documentation module to facilitate the generation of the final deliverable documentation for the 
codebooks. 

5.2  Postdata Collection Editing 

B&B staff edited the B&B:08/12 data using procedures developed and implemented for 

previous studies sponsored by NCES, including B&B:08/09. Following data collection, staff 
subjected the information collected in the interview to various quality control checks and 
examinations. For example, staff conducted these checks to confirm that the collected data reflected 
appropriate item routing (skip patterns). Another evaluation involved examination of all variables 
with missing data and substitution of specific values to indicate the reason for the missing data. The 
most commonly used missing codes are listed in table 40; however, for some items the missing 
values have different meanings. Users should refer to the codebook for information on missing 
values for specific variables. Additionally, reserve codes can be redefined as needed using the 
included data definition files.

B&B staff examined skip-pattern relationships in the interview database by methodically 

cross-tabulating gate items and their associated nested items. In many instances, gate-nest 
relationships spanned multiple levels within the interview. Items nested within a gate question may 
themselves have been gate items for additional items. Consequently, validating the gate-nest 
relationships often required several iterations and many multiway cross-tabulations to ensure that the 
survey captured the proper data.  

The data cleaning and editing process for the full-scale data files involved a multistage 

process that consisted of the following steps:  

B&B:08/12 Data File Documentation 

67 

Chapter 5. Data File Processing and Preparation 

1.  B&B staff replaced blank or missing data with -9 for all variables in the interview 

database. Staff reviewed a one-way frequency distribution of every variable to confirm 
that no missing or blank values remained. SAS formats were created from expected 
values, and the associated value labels revealed any categorical outliers. Staff provided 
descriptive statistics for all continuous variables. Staff temporarily recoded all values that 
were less than zero to missing and examined the minimum, median, maximum, and 
mean values to assess reasonableness of responses. Staff also investigated anomalous 
data patterns and corrected them as necessary.  

2.  B&B staff identified legitimate skips for the interview items using interview source codes 
and flowcharts. Staff defined gate-nest relationships to replace -9s (data missing, reason 
unknown) with -3s (not applicable), as appropriate. For example, if a student was single 
and had never been married, then staff assigned a -3 code to a variable that collected a 
spouse’s income. Staff evaluated two-way cross-tabulations between each gate-nest 
combination; they investigated high numbers of nonreplaced -9 codes to ensure skip-
pattern integrity. They further checked nested values to reveal instances in which the 
legitimate skip code overwrote valid data, which typically occurred if a respondent 
answered a gate question and the appropriate nested items but then reverted to change 
the value of the gate to one that opened up an alternate path of nested items. Because 
responses to the first nested items remained in the database, they required editing.  

3.  B&B staff formatted variables (e.g., they formatted dates as YYYYMM). In addition, 
they merged back into the data file any new codes assigned by expert coders reviewing 
IPEDS, high school, occupation, and major codes (including those strings that 
interviewers or respondents could not code during the interview). Staff reviewing string 
data reviewed several variables, including occupation title and duties as well as major 
field of study, and sanitized strings by removing any inappropriate or revealing 
information. At this stage, they performed logical recodes in the data when someone 
could determine the value of missing items from answers to previous questions or 
preloaded values. For example, if the interview preloaded a student’s date of birth from 
another source (NPSAS:08, B&B:08/09, or CPS), then the interview skipped the date of 
birth question and copied the preloaded value into the variable.  

4.  B&B staff examined descriptive statistics for all continuous variables for out-of-range, or 

outlier, values and replaced them with the value -6 (i.e., out-of-range data).  

Concurrently with data cleaning, documentation was developed to detail question text, 

response options, logical recoding, and the applies to text for each delivered variable (for 
documentation information, see the interview facsimile in appendix F). 

5.3  Data Perturbation 

To protect the confidentiality of NCES data that contain information about specific 
individuals and to minimize disclosure risks, B&B:08/12 data were subject to perturbation 
procedures. Perturbation procedures, which have been approved by the NCES Disclosure Review 
Board, preserve the central tendency estimates but may result in slight increases in nonsampling 
errors. 

All respondents were given a positive probability of being selected for swapping. 

Perturbation was carried out under specific targeted, but undisclosed, swap rates. In data swapping, 
the values of the variables being swapped were exchanged between carefully selected pairs of 

68 

B&B:08/12 Data File Documentation 

Chapter 5. Data File Processing and Preparation 

records: a target record and a donor record. Swapping variables were selected from all questionnaire 
items. 

An extensive data quality check was carried out to assess and limit the impact of swapping. 
For example, the distribution of variables was evaluated pre- and posttreatment to verify that the 
swapping did not greatly affect the distribution. 

5.4  Statistical Imputations 

B&B staff imputed missing data in many variables included in the restricted-use derived file 

(also used in PowerStats) in accordance with mass imputation procedures described by Krotki, 
Black, and Creel (2005). After replacing missing data in those cases where values could be deduced 
with certainty based upon logical relationships among observed variables, the weighted sequential hot 
deck (WSHD) method was used to replace missing data by imputing plausible values from statistically 
selected donor cases (Cox 1980; Iannacchione 1982). 

The first stage in the imputation procedure was the identification of vectors of variables that, 

due to their substantive similarity or shared pattern of missingness, could be imputed 
simultaneously. Then, variables/vectors of variables were prioritized for imputation based upon 
their level of missing data, imputing those variables/vectors of variables with low levels of 
missingness prior to imputing variables where the rate of missingness was greater. For each 
variable/vector of variables, B&B staff identified imputation classes from which donor cases for the 
hot deck procedure would be selected. To develop those classes, nonparametric classification or 
regression trees were used to identify homogeneous subgroups of item respondents (Breiman et al. 
1984), using complete response variables and any previously imputed variables as possible predictor 
variables. Finally, missing data were replaced using the WSHD procedure within each of the 
imputation classes. 

In the second stage of imputation, missing data were replaced using the WSHD procedure. 

To improve imputation quality, this previously described procedure using trees and WSHD was 
combined and implemented with the cyclic n-partition hot deck technique (Marker, Judkins, and 
Winglee 2002), as discussed in Judkins (1997).14 This technique begins by identifying and replacing 
initial imputations for each missing variable (ordered from least to most missingness), based upon 
variables with complete responses and any imputed variables as possible predictors to form the 
imputation classes, within which the WSHD was used. The result was a complete dataset containing 
the variable/vector of variables being reimputed and variables related to the development of 
imputation classes. Then, in each of n iterations, imputed data in each variable (ordered from least to 
most missingness) were erased and a new response was imputed based upon the otherwise complete 
dataset. 

This approach reinforces existing patterns within the data, avoiding the need to make strong 

assumptions about distribution shapes or about prior distributions for parameters. Instead, B&B 
staff members were able to make deliberate choices about which features of the covariance structure 
deserve the best preservation efforts (Marker, Judkins, and Winglee 2002, p. 334). Typically, the 
result of cycling was a convergence to plausible values, maintaining relationships that already exist. 
Rarely, cycling fails to converge, introducing errors because of the missing data pattern and the 
random nature of the imputations.  

                                                 
14 David Judkins is currently referring to this as p-cyclic partition hot deck. He changed n to p because n is often used to denote the 
number of observations, and p the number of variables. 

B&B:08/12 Data File Documentation 

69 

Chapter 5. Data File Processing and Preparation 

To reduce error due to imputation, B&B staff performed quality checks throughout the 

imputation process. In particular, staff compared the distribution of variable values pre- and 
postimputation, examining the data as needed to resolve apparent anomalies. Selected results from 
the imputation process are shown in appendix G, which shows the item response and nonresponse 
rates and pre- and postimputation distributions for each variable subject to imputation for all 
students. 

5.5  Derived Variable Construction 

Analysts created the main study analytic variables by examining the data available for each 
student from the various data sources, prioritizing the data sources on an item-by-item basis, and 
reconciling discrepancies within and between sources. In some cases, staff created derived variables 
by simple assignment of a value from the available source with the highest priority. In other cases, 
they recoded interview items or otherwise summarized them to create a derived variable (for a listing 
of the set of analysis variables derived for B&B:08/12, see appendix H). Details about the creation 
of each variable appear in the variable descriptions contained in the PowerStats documentation and 
codebooks for the restricted files.

Chapter 6.  
Weighting and Variance Estimation 

This chapter provides information pertaining to the weighting procedures used for 

B&B:08/12. The development of statistical analysis weights for the B&B:08/12 sample is discussed 
in section 6.1. Analysis procedures that can be used to produce design-unbiased estimates of 
sampling variances are discussed in section 6.2, including variances computed using Taylor series 
and bootstrap replication techniques. Section 6.2 also describes how the Taylor series strata and 
primary sampling unit (PSU) variables were constructed and how the bootstrap replicate weights 
were constructed. Section 6.3 provides weighted and unweighted response rates. Section 6.4 
discusses the accuracy of B&B:08/12 estimates for precision and the potential for nonresponse bias. 

6.1  Analysis Weights 

The weights for analyzing the B&B:08/12 data were derived from the NPSAS:08 weight, 
because the B&B:08/12 sample members were a subset of the NPSAS:08 sample.15 Three weights 
were developed for analyzing data from the B&B:08/12 data collection. A cross-sectional weight 
was not included because analysis of the B&B:08/12 interview items would almost always be 
analyzed along with NPSAS:08 items, especially demographic items. One weight (bookend) was 
developed for analyzing NPSAS items in combination with B&B:08/12 items directly from or 
derived from the 2012 interview. A second weight (panel) was developed for analyzing NPSAS items 
in combination with B&B:08/09 items directly from or derived from the 2009 interview and 
B&B:08/12 items directly from or derived from the 2012 interview. A third weight (panel transcript) 
was developed for analyzing items from all three previous rounds and items directly from or derived 
from the transcript. The weights were adjusted for nonresponse and were also adjusted to IPEDS 
and NPSAS:08 control totals. This section describes the steps that were followed in order to develop 
each weight. 

The 2007–08 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:08) Full-scale Methodology Report 

(Cominole et al. 2010) (hereinafter referred to as the NPSAS:08 full-scale methodology report) 
describes the development of the NPSAS study weight. The statistical analysis weight compensated 
for the unequal probability of selection of institutions and students in the NPSAS:08 sample. The 
weight also adjusted for multiplicity at the institution and student levels, unknown student eligibility, 
nonresponse, and poststratification. The institution weight was computed and then used as a 
component of the student weight. A weight was computed for NPSAS:08 respondents as the 
product of the following 10 weight components: 

• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

institution sampling weight (WT1); 
institution multiplicity adjustment (WT2); 
institution poststratification adjustment (WT3); 
institution nonresponse adjustment (WT4); 
student sampling weight (WT5); 
student multiplicity adjustment (WT6); 

                                                 
15 Because the B&B:08/12 sample includes B&B:08/09 respondents and nonrespondents, B&B:08/12 weighting could not start with 
the adjusted B&B:08/09 weights, as they were only computed for respondents.  

B&B:08/12 Data File Documentation

student unknown eligibility adjustment (WT7); 
student not located adjustment (WT8); 
student other nonresponse adjustment (WT9); and 
student poststratification adjustment (WT10). 

• 
• 
• 
• 
The B&B:08/12 sample contains both NPSAS study respondents and nonrespondents. 

Therefore, the B&B:08/12 base weight was formed as the product of the first seven of these 
adjustment factors.  

The subsample of 500 NPSAS:08 interview nonrespondents was selected with probabilities 
proportional to the NPSAS:08 student weight. The B&B:08/12 base weight was multiplied by the 
inverse of this selection probability for the subsampled cases to obtain the weight for cases in the 
sample. 

An adjustment was made for nonresponse, as defined for each analysis weight (see 

subsections below), using a model-based constrained logistic weighting procedure. The weights were 
then calibrated to IPEDS and weight sums from NPSAS:08, which had been calibrated to IPEDS 
and external control totals as described in the NPSAS:08 full-scale methodology report.16 The 
procedure WTADJUST in SUDAAN (RTI 2012) was used to implement the nonresponse and 
calibration adjustments. This weighting methodology is described by Folsom and Singh (2000).  

The distribution of sample characteristics for refusals and other nonrespondents was 
reviewed to determine if a two-stage nonresponse adjustment was warranted to better reduce 
nonresponse bias. However, there was not a discernible difference in distributions, so one stage of 
nonresponse adjustment was conducted for all of the analysis weights. The adjustment for the 
nonresponse model included the eligible cases who were not deceased; the response indicator was 
set to 1 for the respondents and to 0 for nonrespondents. Independent variables were chosen that 
were considered to be predictive of response status and were nonmissing for respondents and 
nonrespondents. Variables for the model include the frame and survey design variables that were 
used for the NPSAS:08 weight adjustments and other data known for both the respondents and 
nonrespondents. Candidate predictor variables include the following:17 

institution control; 
region; 
institution enrollment from IPEDS file (categorical); 

• 
• 
• 
•  Pell Grant receipt (yes/no); 
•  Pell Grant amount (categorical); 
•  Stafford Loan receipt (yes/no); 
•  Stafford Loan amount (categorical); 
•  Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) amount (categorical); 
• 

federal aid receipt (yes/no); 

                                                 
16 Calibration in this chapter generally refers to adjusting the weights to weight sums, and poststratification generally refers to adjusting 
the weights to external totals. However, these terms are sometimes used interchangeably when referring to both types of adjustments 
at the same time. 
17 The enrollment and financial aid amount categories were formed based on quartiles.

institution aid receipt (yes/no);

predictor variables, as well as certain important two-way and three-way interactions. To identify 
these interactions, a chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) analysis was performed on the 
predictor variables (Kass 1980). The CHAID analysis divided the data into segments that differed 
with respect to the response variable. The segmentation process first divided the sample into groups 
based on categories of the most significant predictor of response. It then split each of these groups 
into smaller subgroups based on other predictor variables. It also merged categories of a variable 
that were found to be nonsignificant predictors of response propensity.  

To ensure population coverage and consistency with NPSAS:08 and B&B:08/09, the 

analysis weights were further adjusted to control totals. Variables used to define the control totals 
were similar to those used for the poststratification adjustments for B&B:08/09. The control totals 
for the B&B:08/12 bookend weight were obtained using the weighted sums from NPSAS:08 (using 
the NPSAS:08 study weights18) for the following variables for the full B&B cohort (including 
ineligible and deceased students):  

•  number of Stafford Loan recipients by institution control;19 
• 
• 

total amount of Pell Grants awarded;20 and 
amount of PLUS Loans awarded by institution control. 

The control totals for the B&B:08/12 panel and transcript panel weights were obtained using the 
weighted sums from the bookend weight for the same variables. 

Additionally, control totals were formed from IPEDS counts of bachelor’s degree recipients 

for institution control, sex, and major. The following variables were used in defining control totals 
from IPEDs:21 

•  2007–08 recipients of baccalaureate degree by sex; 
•  2007–08 recipients of baccalaureate degree by institution control; and 
•  2007–08 recipients of baccalaureate degree by major (12 categories). 

                                                 
18 NPSAS:08 weights were revised in August 2013. These revised weights were used to create control totals. 
19 NPSAS:08 weights attempted to control to total Stafford Loan amounts disbursed in addition to the number of Stafford Loan 
recipients, but the B&B calibration model would not converge with both of them included. As a result, they were controlled only to 
the number of recipients. 
20 The calibration model would not converge with amount of Pell Grants awarded by institution control, so total amount of Pell 
Grants awarded was used instead. 
21 The IPEDS control totals are from the HD2008 and C2008_A files and can be downloaded from the online IPEDS data center at: 
http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/DataFiles.aspx.  

B&B:08/12 Data File Documentation 

73 

Chapter 6. Weighting and Variance Estimation 

The control totals from NPSAS include cases who became ineligible or were deceased. Thus, 

the ineligible and deceased cases were included in the calibration adjustment to the NPSAS totals 
but not the IPEDS totals. After the adjustment, the ineligible and deceased cases were dropped from 
the file; the sum of the final weights estimates the number of the NPSAS:08 population who were 
eligible for B&B and were still alive at the time of the B&B:08/12 interview.  

As part of the calibration process, students with extreme (outlier) weights had different 

bounds on their adjustment factors to accomplish weight trimming and smoothing in the same step 
as calibration. Extreme weights were identified as weights greater than the median weight plus 3 
times the interquartile range or less than the median weight minus 3 times the interquartile range. 
Weight values outside of these bounds were trimmed to fall within the bounds. 

To assess the overall predictive ability of the nonresponse model, a Receiver Operating 

Characteristic (ROC) curve was used (Hanley and McNeil 1982). The ROC provides a measure of 
how well the model correctly classified individuals of known response type—in other words, how 
well the model predicts a student’s response propensity.22 The ROC curve was developed in the 
following manner. For any specified probability, c, two proportions were calculated: 

• 

• 

the proportion of respondents with a predicted probability of response greater than c; 
and 
the proportion of nonrespondents with a predicted probability of response greater 
than c. 

The plot of the first probability against the second, for c ranging from 0 to 1, resulted in the 

ROC curve shown in figure 8. The area under the curve equals the probability that a randomly 
chosen pair of observations—one respondent and one nonrespondent—will be correctly ranked. 
The probability of a correct pairwise ranking was the same quantity that was estimated by the 
nonparametric Wilcoxon statistic. The null hypothesis associated with the Wilcoxon statistic was 
that the variable was not a useful discriminator between the respondent and nonrespondent 
populations. This corresponds to the null hypothesis that the predicted response probability of a 
respondent was just as likely to be smaller than the predicted response probability of a 
nonrespondent as it was to be greater. Thus, if the null hypothesis is true, the ROC curve will be a 
diagonal line that reflects the equally likely chance of making a correct or incorrect decision, and the 
area under the curve will be 0.5. If the null hypothesis is not true, the ROC curve will rise above the 
diagonal, and the area under the curve will be significantly greater than 0.5.  

Figure 8 in section 6.1 shows that the area under the ROC curve is 0.83, such that 83 percent 

of the time (about 8 of 10 pairings) the predicted probabilities of response give the correct 
classification. The ROC area of 0.83 equals the value of the Wilcoxon test statistic; based on this 
result, the null hypothesis of no predictive ability (p < 0.05) is rejected. This level of discrimination 
implies that the variables used in the model were highly informative, but not definite, predictors of a 
sample student’s overall response propensity.

6.1.1  Bookend Analysis Weight 

A B&B:08/12 bookend respondent was defined as any sample member who was determined 
to be eligible for the study, was not deceased at the time of the B&B:08/12 data collection, and had 
a completed, partial, or abbreviated interview in 2012 and was considered a study respondent for 
NPSAS:08. Among the eligible B&B:08 cohort, about 14,560 were classified as bookend 
respondents, yielding a weighted response rate of 77 percent. The B&B:08/12 sample consisted of 
17,110 eligible students. At the conclusion of the B&B:08/12 data collection, 14,560 students were 
initially determined to be eligible respondents, 2,560 were nonrespondents, 30 were ineligible, and 20 
were deceased.  

Variables that made up the CHAID interaction terms were NPSAS sector, institution 

enrollment, geographic region, number of times an answering machine was encountered, counts of

phone numbers and e-mail addresses available for a student, Stafford Loan receipt, and PLUS 
amount. The initial model including all variables did not converge, requiring some variables to be 
dropped. Retained variables are listed in table 42. 

The predictor variables used in the model to adjust the weight for nonrespondents and the 

average weight adjustment factors resulting from these variables are shown in table 42. The 
nonrespondent weight adjustment factors have the following characteristics: 

•  minimum: 1.00; 
•  median: 1.00; and 
•  maximum: 2.50.

The weight distributions and the variance inflation due to unequal weighting by institution 

control are summarized in table 44. The median bookend weight ranges from 25 for students whose 
base-year institution was for-profit to 86 for students whose base-year institution was public. The

mean bookend weight ranges from 100 for students whose base-year institution was private 
nonprofit to 124 for students whose base-year institution was public. The unequal weighting effect 
overall was 2.44 and ranged from 2.33 for students whose base-year institution was public to 3.04 
for students whose base-year institution was for-profit.

6.1.2  Panel Analysis Weight 

A B&B:08/12 panel respondent was defined as any sample member who met the requirements 

to be classified as a bookend respondent (described above) who also had a completed, partial, or 
abbreviated interview in 2009. Among the eligible B&B:08 cohort, 13,490 cases met the 
requirements to be classified as a panel respondent with a weighted response rate of 68 percent. 

Variables that made up the CHAID interaction terms were institution enrollment, 

geographic region, number of times an answering machine was encountered, counts of phone 
numbers, and e-mail and mailing addresses available for a student. The initial model including all 
variables did not converge, requiring some variables to be dropped. Retained variables are listed in 
table 45. 

Table 45 shows the predictor variables used in the model to adjust the weight for 

nonrespondents and the average weight adjustment factors resulting from these variables. The 
nonrespondent weight adjustment factors have the following characteristics: 

•  minimum: 1.00; 
•  median: 1.00; and 
•  maximum: 3.00.

The weight distributions and the variance inflation due to unequal weighting by institution 
control are summarized in table 47. The median panel weight ranges from 27 for students whose 
base-year institution was for-profit to 89 for students whose base-year institution was public. The 
mean panel weight ranges from 108 for students whose base-year institution was private nonprofit 
to 134 for students whose base-year institution was public. The unequal weighting effect overall was 
2.48 and ranged from 2.37 for students whose base-year institution was public to 3.04 for students 
whose base-year institution was for-profit.

pairings) the predicted probabilities give the correct classification (figure 9). The ROC area of 0.77 
equals the value of the Wilcoxon test statistic; based on the result, the null hypothesis of no 
predictive ability (p < 0.05) is rejected. This level of discrimination implies that the variables used in 
the model were highly informative, but not definite, predictors of a sample student’s overall

6.1.3  Transcript Panel Analysis Weight 

A B&B:08/12 transcript panel respondent was defined as any sample member who was a panel 

respondent who also had a transcript provided by the NPSAS:08 institution. The B&B:08/12 
sample consisted of 17,070 eligible students.23 Using the transcript panel weight, 12,570 students 
were classified as eligible respondents, yielding a weighted response rate of 64 percent.  

Variables that made up the CHAID interaction terms were NPSAS sector, institution 

financial aid, state financial aid, any financial aid, geographic region, number of times an answering 
machine was encountered, counts of phone numbers, and e-mail addresses available for a student. 
The initial model including all variables did not converge, requiring some variables to be dropped. 
Retained variables are listed in table 48. 

The predictor variables used in the model to adjust the weight for nonrespondents and the 

average weight adjustment factors resulting from these variables are shown in table 48. The 
nonrespondent weight adjustment factors have the following characteristics: 

•  minimum: 1.00; 
•  median: 1.04; and 
•  maximum: 3.00. 

                                                 
23 The number of students eligible for both the B&B:08/12 interview and transcripts differs from the number of students eligible for 
the B&B:08/12 interview due to perturbation (see section 5.3).

6.2  Variance Estimation 

For probability-based sample surveys, most estimates are nonlinear statistics. For example, a 

mean or proportion, which is expressed as  

m

=

xw
i

i

yw
i

i

 

∑
∑

i

i

is nonlinear because the denominator is a survey estimate of the (unknown) population total. In this 
situation, the variances of the estimates cannot be expressed in closed form. Two procedures for 
estimating variances of survey statistics are the Taylor series linearization procedure and the 
bootstrap replication procedure. Variables used for both of these variance estimation procedures are 
available on the B&B:08/12 data files. The analysis strata and PSUs created for the Taylor series 
procedure are discussed in section 6.2.1, and section 6.2.2 contains a discussion of the replicate 
weights created for the bootstrap procedure. 

6.2.1  Taylor Series 

The Taylor series variance estimation procedure is a well-known technique used to estimate 
the variances of nonlinear statistics. The procedure takes the first-order Taylor series approximation 
of the nonlinear statistic and then substitutes the linear representation into the appropriate variance 
formula based on the sample design. Woodruff (1971) presented the mathematical formulation of 
this procedure. 

For stratified multistage surveys, the Taylor series procedure requires variance estimation 

(analysis) strata and variance estimation (analysis) PSUs defined from the sampling strata and PSUs 
used in the first stage of sampling. Because B&B:08/12 is the second follow-up study of NPSAS:08, 
the variance estimation strata and PSUs for B&B:08/12 were derived from the variance estimation 
strata and PSUs that were originally developed for NPSAS:08 and then modified for B&B:08/09. 
The steps involved in the construction of the NPSAS:08 strata and PSU variables are described in 
chapter 6 of the NPSAS:08 full-scale methodology report (Cominole et al. 2010). The process for 
the construction of the B&B:08/09 strata and PSU variables was similar to the process used for 
B&B:08/12, which is described below. 

The variance estimation formulas require at least two PSUs in each stratum. The B&B:08/09 
variance estimation strata and PSUs were examined for the B&B:08/12 sample, and strata with only 
one PSU were combined with other strata to obtain at least two PSUs. The following three rules 
were used: variance estimation strata were combined with other variance estimation strata within the 
original NPSAS:08 sampling strata; certainty schools were combined with other certainty schools; 
and noncertainty schools were combined with other noncertainty schools. In addition, the original 
sort order that was used for constructing the NPSAS:08 variance estimation strata and PSUs was 
used. If the stratum was the first in the sorted list, then it was combined with the next stratum in the 
list; otherwise, it was combined with either the previous or next stratum. The single PSU then 
became an additional PSU in the new variance estimation stratum. The resulting variance estimation 
strata and PSUs for B&B:08/12 are the variables ANALSTR and ANALPSU. Note that these strata 
and PSUs were formed such that they were applicable to use with any of the three analysis weights 
described in section 6.1.

Chapter 6. Weighting and Variance Estimation 

The procedure described above may overestimate the variance because it does not always 

account for the finite population correction (FPC) at the institution stage of sampling. Alternatively, 
the Taylor series procedure can account for the FPC if the variance estimation (analysis) secondary 
sampling units (SSUs) and PSU counts were considered in addition to the analysis strata and analysis 
PSUs. The variables used to implement this procedure were FANALSTR, FANALPSU, 
FANALSSU, and PSUCOUNT for the analysis strata, PSUs, SSUs and PSU counts, respectively. An 
alternate variance estimation method using replicate weights to account for the FPC is also provided 
for users of the B&B:08/12 data, as described below. 

6.2.2  Bootstrap Replicate Weights 

The variance estimation strategy that was chosen for B&B:08/12 was the same as that used 

for B&B:08/09 and NPSAS:08, and it satisfies the following requirements: 

• 
• 
• 
• 

• 

• 

• 

recognition of variance reduction due to stratification at all stages of sampling; 
recognition of effects of unequal weighting; 
recognition of possible increased variance due to sample clustering; 
recognition of effects of weight adjustments for nonresponse and for calibration of 
selected total estimates to known external totals or weight sums; 
satisfactory properties for estimating variances of nonlinear statistics and quantiles (such 
as the median) as well as for linear statistics; 
ability to apply finite population corrections at the institution stage of sampling and 
reflect the reduction in variance due to the high sampling rates in some first-stage 
sampling strata; and 
ability to test hypotheses about students on the basis of normal distribution theory by 
ignoring the finite population corrections at the student level of sampling. 

The replicate weights were produced using a methodology combining approaches developed 

by Flyer (1987) and Kott (1988). The Flyer-Kott approach is described in the NPSAS:08 full-scale 
methodology report (Cominole et al. 2010). The Flyer-Kott methodology was used to develop a 
vector of bootstrap sample weights that was added to the analysis file. These weights are zero for 
units not selected in a particular bootstrap sample; weights for other units are inflated for the 
bootstrap subsampling. The initial analytic weights for the complete sample are also included to 
compute the desired estimates. The vector of replicate weights allows for computing additional 
estimates for the sole purpose of estimating a variance. Assuming B sets of replicate weights, the 
variance of any estimate, θˆ, can be estimated by replicating the estimation procedure for each 
replicate and computing a simple variance of the replicate estimates; that,

2012] computes this estimate by invoking the DESIGN=BRR option).

The number of replicate weights was set at 200 for NPSAS:08. For the three sets of 200 
replicate weights included on the analysis file, both the nonresponse adjustment and calibration 
process were repeated so that the variance of survey estimates would include the variability due to 
the weight adjustments. For some of the replicates, the adjustment factor bounds were loosened and 
not all of the control totals could be met because of model convergence problems; i.e., there was no 
solution to satisfy all model equations simultaneously. The analysis and replicate weights that are 
available on the analysis file for B&B:08/12 are the following:

6.3  Overall Weighted and Unweighted Response Rates 

The overall B&B:08/12 response rate was an estimate of the proportion of the study 
population directly represented by the respondents. Because the B&B:08/12 study includes a 
subsample of NPSAS:08 nonrespondents, the overall B&B:08/12 response rate was the product of 
the NPSAS:08 institution-level response rate times the B&B:08/12 student-level response rate. 
Therefore, the overall B&B:08/12 response rates can only be estimated directly for defined 
institution characteristics.  

The unweighted and weighted NPSAS:08 base-year institution and B&B:08/12 student 

response rate components by institution control are shown in table 52. Only the weighted response 
rates can be interpreted as estimates of the proportion of the B&B:08/12 population that was 
directly represented by the respondents. The types of student respondents were the following:24 
•  B&B:08/12 bookend respondents (i.e., NPSAS:08 study respondent and B&B:08/12 

interview respondent); 

•  B&B:08/12 panel respondents (i.e., NPSAS:08 study respondent and B&B:08/09 and 

B&B:08/12 interview respondents); and

The institution-level response rates were the percentage of institutions that provided 

sufficient data to select the NPSAS:08 student-level sample; these rates are presented and discussed 
in the NPSAS:08 full-scale methodology report (Cominole et al. 2010, p. 50).  

Approximately 77 percent of the eligible sample were NPSAS:08 study respondents and 
B&B:08/12 interview respondents. The rate varied from 75 percent to 78 percent, by institution 
control. The overall weighted response rate, incorporating the NPSAS:08 base-year institution 
response rate, was 69 percent. The bookend analysis weight described in section 6.1 (WTD000) was 
developed to compensate for the potentially biasing effects of bookend nonresponse. 

Approximately 68 percent of the eligible sample were NPSAS:08 study respondents and 

B&B:08/09 and B&B:08/12 interview respondents. The rate varied from 61 percent to 70 percent, 
by institution control. The overall weighted response rate, incorporating the NPSAS:08 base-year 
institution response rate, was 61 percent. The panel analysis weight described in section 6.1 
(WTE000) was developed to compensate for the potentially biasing effects of panel nonresponse. 

Approximately 64 percent of the eligible sample were NPSAS:08 study respondents, 

B&B:08/09 and B&B:08/12 interview respondents, and transcript respondents. The rate varied 
from 60 percent to 66 percent, by institution control. The overall weighted response rate, 
incorporating the NPSAS:08 base-year institution response rate, was 58 percent. The transcript panel 
analysis weight described in section 6.1 (WTF000) was developed to compensate for the potentially 
biasing effects of transcript panel nonresponse.

B&B:08/12 Data File Documentation 

Chapter 6. Weighting and Variance Estimation 

Section 6.4.2 analyzes the potential bias due to unit nonresponse and the effect the weight 

adjustments had in reducing the bias. 

6.4  Accuracy of Estimates  

The accuracy of survey statistics is affected by both random and nonrandom errors. Random 
errors reduce the precision of survey estimates, while nonrandom errors result in bias (i.e., estimates 
that do not converge to the true population parameter as the sample size increases without limit).  

The sources of error in a survey are often dichotomized as sampling and nonsampling 

errors. Sampling error refers to the error that occurs because the survey was based on a sample of 
population members rather than the entire population. All other types of errors are nonsampling errors, 
including survey nonresponse (because of inability to contact sampling members, their refusal to 
participate in the study, etc.) and measurement errors, such as the errors that occur because the 
intent of survey questions was not clear to the respondent, because the respondent had insufficient 
knowledge to answer correctly, or because the data were not captured correctly (e.g., because of 
recording, editing, or data entry errors). 

The sampling errors are primarily random errors for well-designed surveys such as 

NPSAS:08 and B&B:08/12. However, nonrandom errors can occur if the sampling frame does not 
provide complete coverage of the target population. The B&B:08/12 survey instrument and data 
collection procedures were subjected to thorough development and testing to minimize 
nonsampling errors, because these errors are difficult to quantify and are likely to be nonrandom 
errors. 

In this section, sampling errors and design effects for some B&B:08/12 estimates are 

presented for a variety of domains; these sampling errors and design effects are computed using the 
three analysis weights that were constructed for analyzing the B&B:08/12 student data in 
conjunction with NPSAS:08, B&B:08/09, and transcript data. 

Next, the results of analyses comparing B&B:08/12 nonrespondents with respondents and 

with the full sample using characteristics known for both nonrespondents and respondents are 
presented. An analysis of nonresponse bias is presented at both the student level and the item level. 

6.4.1  Measures of Precision: Standard Errors and Design Effects 

The survey design effect for a statistic was defined as the ratio of the design-based variance 

estimate divided by the variance estimate that would have been obtained from a simple random 
sample of the same size (if that were practical). It is often used to measure the effects that sample 
design features have on the precision of survey estimates. For example, stratification tends to 
decrease the variance, but multistage sampling and unequal sampling rates usually increase the 
variance. In addition, weight adjustments for nonresponse (performed to reduce nonresponse bias) 
and calibration often increase the variance by increasing the weight variation. Because of these 
effects, most complex multistage sampling designs, such as B&B:08/12, result in design effects 
greater than 1.0. That is, the design-based variance is larger than the simple random sample variance. 

Specifically, the survey design effect for a given estimate,  ˆθ , was defined as 

Deff

Chapter 6. Weighting and Variance Estimation 

The square root of the design effect is another measure and can be expressed as the ratio of 

the standard errors, or 

Deft

ˆ(θ)

=

design

SE
SE

srs

ˆ(θ)
ˆ(θ)

. 

In appendix I, design effect estimates are presented for important survey domains and 

estimates in order to summarize the effects of stratification, multistage sampling, unequal 
probabilities of selection, and the weight adjustments. These design effects were estimated for 
B&B:08/12 using SUDAAN and the bootstrap variance estimation procedure described in 
section 6.2.2. While not recommended, if an analysis of B&B:08/12 data must be performed without 
using one of the software packages for analysis of complex survey data, the design effect tables in 
appendix I can be used to make approximate adjustments to the standard errors of survey statistics 
computed with the standard software packages that assume simple random sampling designs. 
However, one cannot be confident about the actual design-based standard errors without 
performing the analysis with one of the software packages specifically designed for analysis of data 
from complex sample surveys. 

Large design effects imply large standard errors and relatively poor precision. Small design 

effects imply small standard errors and good precision. In general terms, a design effect less than 2.0 
is low, 2.0 to 3.0 is moderate, and greater than 3.0 is high. Moderate and high design effects often 
occur in complex surveys such as B&B:08/12, and the design effects presented in appendix I are 
consistent with those in past B&B studies. Unequal weighting causes large design effects and is often 
due to nonresponse and calibration adjustments. However, in B&B:08/12 (as in NPSAS:08), the 
unequal weighting is also due to the sample design, different sampling rates between institution 
strata, different sampling rates between student strata, and subsampling of the nonrespondents who 
were included in B&B:08/09 and B&B:08/12.  

6.4.2  Measure of Bias 

The bias in an estimated mean based on respondents,  Ry

, is the difference between this 

mean and the target parameter, π, that is, the mean that would be estimated if a complete census of 
the target population was conducted and everyone responded. This bias can be expressed as follows, 
where 

 is the expected value of the mean based on respondents over repeated samples: 

(
)RyE

) π−
. 
The estimated mean based on nonrespondents,  NRy
, can be computed if data for the 

(
yE

(
yB

)

R

particular variable are available for most of the nonrespondents. The true target parameter, π, can be 
estimated for these variables as follows: 
ˆ
π

)
y
η η

(
1
= −

+

y

, 

R

NR

where η is the weighted unit (or item) nonresponse rate. For the variables that are from the frame, 
rather than from the sample, π can be estimated without sampling error. The bias can then be 
estimated as follows: 

ˆ
(
B y

R

)

=

ˆ
y π
−  
R

or, equivalently, 

ˆ
(
B y

R

)

(
η=

y

R

−

y

NR

)

. 

This formula shows that the estimate of the nonresponse bias is the difference between the mean 
for respondents and nonrespondents multiplied by the weighted nonresponse rate. 

The relative bias estimate was defined as the ratio of the estimated bias divided by the 

sample mean, using the base weight, as follows:  
)
R =

(ˆRe
yBl

(ˆ
yB

/)

ˆπy
.

This definition of relative bias provides a measure of the magnitude of the bias relative to the 
estimated sample mean.  

Nonresponse bias analysis was conducted when the response rate at any level (institutions, 
students, items) was below 85 percent.25 Institution nonresponse bias was performed as a part of 
NPSAS:08 and is described in the NPSAS:08 full-scale methodology report (Cominole et al. 2010). 
A student nonresponse bias analysis was performed for the bookend, panel, and transcript panel 
analysis weights, and an item nonresponse bias analysis was also performed. The remainder of this 
section summarizes the unit and item nonresponse bias analyses that were conducted for 
B&B:08/12. 

Unit nonresponse bias analysis. The bookend, panel, and transcript panel weighted 

response rates were below 85 percent overall and for all three institution controls, so a nonresponse 
bias analysis was conducted overall and within each institution control. Unit nonresponse bias 
analyses were conducted for the following sets of respondents: 

•  B&B:08/12 bookend respondents versus the full set of cases eligible for B&B:08/12 

(bookend respondents and bookend nonrespondents), before and after the nonresponse 
weight adjustment; 

•  B&B:08/12 bookend respondents versus B&B:08/12 bookend nonrespondents, before 

the nonresponse weight adjustment; 

•  B&B:08/12 panel respondents versus the full set of cases eligible for B&B:08/12 (panel 

respondents and panel nonrespondents), before and after the nonresponse weight 
adjustment;  

•  B&B:08/12 panel respondents versus B&B:08/12 panel nonrespondents, before the 

nonresponse weight adjustment; 

•  B&B:08/12 transcript panel respondents versus the full set of cases eligible for 

B&B:08/12 (transcript panel respondents and transcript panel nonrespondents), before 
and after the nonresponse weight adjustment; and 

•  B&B:08/12 transcript panel respondents versus B&B:08/12 transcript panel 

nonrespondents, before the nonresponse weight adjustment. 

The nonresponse bias was estimated for variables known—that is, nonmissing—for most 

respondents and nonrespondents, and some variables were added that were not included in the

nonresponse weight adjustment. Bias estimates were suppressed for variable categories with fewer 
than 30 nonrespondents. The following variables were used in the analyses:26 

institution control; 
region; 
institution enrollment from IPEDS file (categorical); 

• 
• 
• 
•  Pell Grant receipt (yes/no); 
•  Pell Grant amount (categorical); 
•  Stafford Loan receipt (yes/no); 
•  Stafford Loan amount (categorical); 
•  PLUS (categorical); 
• 
• 
• 
• 
•  major (categorical); 
sex; 
• 
age as of NPSAS:08 (categorical); and 
• 
•  CPS match as of NPSAS:08 (yes/no). 
First, for the variables listed above, the nonresponse bias was estimated by comparing 

federal aid receipt (yes/no); 
institution aid receipt (yes/no); 
state aid receipt (yes/no); and 
any aid receipt (yes/no); 

estimates from base-weighted respondents with those of both nonrespondents and the full sample 
to determine if the differences were statistically significant at the 5 percent level. The two 
comparisons yield identical bias estimates but not always the same significance-testing results. 
Second, nonresponse adjustments were computed to reduce or eliminate nonresponse bias for key 
variables included in the models. Third, using base weights adjusted for nonresponse, bias was re-
estimated and statistical tests were performed to check for any remaining significant nonresponse 
bias. Finally, to better understand the effect of poststratification on efforts to reduce nonresponse 
bias, two additional sets of estimates were created. The first, the difference between respondent 
means before and after poststratification, represents the effect of poststratification on nonresponse 
adjustments. The second, the difference between base-weighted full sample means and the 
poststratified respondent means, represents the cumulative effect of all weighting and adjustment 
steps. 

The nonresponse weighting adjustment eliminated some, but not all, significant bias on these 

characteristics (table 53).27 Before weighting, the percentage of variable categories that were 
significantly biased ranged from 2.9 percent among for-profit institutions with the panel and 
transcript panel weights to 49.0 percent among public institutions with the panel weight. The 
percentage of variable categories that remained significantly biased after the nonresponse weight 
adjustment ranged from 0.0 percent among private nonprofit institutions with the bookend and 
                                                 
26 The enrollment and financial aid amount categories were formed based on quartiles. 
27 Bias analyses compare estimates from respondents to those of the full sample.

transcript panel weights to 13.8 percent among for-profit institutions with the bookend weight. As 
shown in appendix J, overall, significant bias remained for two or fewer categories of major and 
both categories of sex for each analysis weight. Significant bias estimates ranged from -2.0 to 2.0 
percent. Among public institutions, two or fewer categories of institution enrollment and three or 
fewer categories of major had remaining significant bias for each analysis weight. Additionally, both 
categories of sex were significantly biased for the transcript panel weight. The significant bias 
estimates ranged from -1.9 to 2.3 percent. Among private nonprofit institutions, one category of 
region had significant bias of -1.5 percent for the panel weight, and no variables had significant bias 
remaining for the other two weights. Among for-profit institutions, two or fewer categories of 
enrollment had remaining significant bias for each analysis weight, and both categories of state aid 
status had significant bias for the bookend weight. The bias estimates ranged from -6.1 to 5.0 
percent.

Across all three weights, the mean and median absolute differences between means for 

respondents before and after poststratification adjustment are less than 2.0 for the overall, public, 
and nonprofit institutions and greater than 4.4 for the for-profit institutions (table 54). The 
differences between means for the full sample and respondents after poststratification adjustment 
are less than 2.0 for the overall, public, and nonprofit institutions and greater than 3.4 for the for-
profit institutions. See appendix J, tables J-1 through J-24, for detailed nonresponse bias analysis 
tables.

Item nonresponse bias analysis. NCES Statistical Standard 4-4-3A states: “For an item 

with a low total response rate, respondents and nonrespondents can be compared on sampling 
frame and/or questionnaire variables for which data on respondents and nonrespondents are 

102 

B&B:08/12 Data File Documentation 

Chapter 6. Weighting and Variance Estimation 

available. Base weights must be used in such analysis. Comparison items should have very high 
response rates. A full range of available items should be used for these comparisons. This approach 
may be limited to the extent that items available for respondents and nonrespondents may not be 
related to the low response rate item being analyzed” (Seastrom 2014). 

Moreover, NCES Statistical Standard 1-3-5 states: “Item response rates (RRI) are calculated 
as the ratio of the number of respondents for whom an in-scope response was obtained (Ix for item 
x) to the number of respondents who are asked to answer that item. The number asked to answer an 
item is the number of unit level respondents (I) minus the number of respondents with a valid skip 
for item x (Vx). When an abbreviated questionnaire is used to convert refusals, the eliminated 
questions are treated as item nonresponse. In longitudinal analyses, the numerator of an item 
response rate includes cases that have data available for all waves included in the analysis and the 
denominator includes the number of respondents eligible to respond in all waves included in the 
analysis. In the case of constructed variables, the numerator includes cases that have available data 
for the full set of items required to construct the variable, and the denominator includes all 
respondents eligible to respond to all items in the constructed variable” (Seastrom 2014). The item 
response rate is calculated as 

RRIx = Ix / (I – Vx). 

Item response rates were computed using nonimputed data. Valid skips were later logically 
imputed for the follow-up items after the gate question was imputed (but these imputed skips count 
as missing for computing the response rate). Table G-1 in appendix G lists the items from the 
B&B:08/12 interview along with the number of cases who were eligible to answer each item and the 
weighted item response rates and nonresponse rates. The B&B:08/12 bookend weight (WTD000) 
was used to calculate the response rates. The nonresponse rate was also the same as the percentage 
of cases for which the item was imputed. Cases who did not respond to a gate item were treated as 
missing for the items within the gate. Of the 176 items listed in table G-1, 47 had an item response 
rate less than 85 percent. 

A nonresponse bias analysis was conducted for items with a weighted response rate less than 

85 percent for B&B:08/12 bookend respondents. The possibility of estimating the degree of bias 
depends on having some variables that reflect key characteristics of respondents and for which there 
are little or no missing data. The variables that were used (a subset of the bulleted list above28) are 
known for all B&B:08/12 interview respondents and nonrespondents. These variables are important 
to the study and are related to many of the items being analyzed for low item response rates. For the 
items with a weighted response rate less than 85 percent, the nonresponse bias prior to imputation 
was estimated for each of these characteristics that are known for respondents and nonrespondents. 

Table J-25 in appendix J is included as an example of the bias analyses conducted for each 
item. It presents the estimated bias (prior to item imputation) for Private student loan status in 2012 
(B2PRIVSTAT) for B&B:08/12 bookend respondents. Similar computations were performed for 
each of the items. Table J-26 summarizes the results of the item nonresponse bias analysis for each 
of the items from the student interview with a response rate of less than 85 percent, and gives the 
mean and median relative bias and the percentage of the variable categories with statistically 
significant bias. Across the items, the percentage of variables with statistically significant bias ranged 
from 18 to 45 percent. 

                                                 
28 The item-level nonresponse bias analysis did not include those variables that were added to the student-level nonresponse bias 
analysis and not included in the nonresponse weight adjustment.

Chapter 6. Weighting and Variance Estimation 

Item imputation was used to fill in missing data for B&B:08/12 interview respondents, as 
described in chapter 5. Item imputation was expected to reduce the bias due to item nonresponse 
and was used instead of a separate weight adjustment for nonresponse for each item. All of the 
questionnaire items that are listed in table G-1 were imputed using the imputation process described 
in chapter 5.  

A by-product of imputation was the reduction or elimination of item-level nonresponse bias. 

While item-level bias before imputation was measurable, after imputation it was not. As a result, 
how well an imputation procedure worked in reducing bias could not be directly evaluated. Instead, 
the before- and after-imputation item estimates were compared to determine whether the 
imputation significantly changed the biased estimates, thus suggesting a reduction in bias. Weighted 
estimates were computed using the nonimputed data (including only those cases who responded to 
the item) and also using the imputed data (including cases who responded to the item and also cases 
with imputed data for the item). Table G-2 shows the means before and after imputation for the 
continuous variables, and table G-3 shows the distributions before and after imputation for the 
categorical variables. These tables also show the difference between the preimputation and 
postimputation estimates. The difference between the pre- and postimputation estimates was 
statistically significant for 10 percent of the variables and variable categories included in the 
nonresponse bias analysis (see table J-26).29 This suggests that imputation was only slightly successful 
in reducing the bias due to item nonresponse. 

 

                                                 
29 Statistical testing of differences was not conducted for variable categories with fewer than 30 item-level nonrespondents.

Appendix C. Field Test Report 

Chapter 1.  
Overview 
The 2008/12 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:08/12), conducted for the 

National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in the U.S. Department of Education’s (ED’s) 
Institute of Education Sciences, provides information on respondents’ postbaccalaureate education 
and employment. B&B:08/12 is the second follow-up of a panel of baccalaureate degree recipients 
identified in the 2007–08 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:08). 

This report describes the methodology and findings of the B&B:08/12 field test, which took 

place during the 2010–11 school year. The field test was used to plan, implement, and evaluate 
methodological procedures, instruments, and systems proposed for use in the full-scale study 
scheduled for the 2011–12 school year. 

1.1  Sampling Design 

The respondent universe for the B&B:08/12 field test consisted of students who completed 
degree requirements for a bachelor’s degree between July 1, 2006, and June 30, 2007, at any Title IV 
eligible postsecondary institution in the United States and Puerto Rico. The sample comprised all 
2008/09 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:08/09) field test eligible interview 
respondents, including those who were not NPSAS:08 interview respondents. The B&B:08/12 field 
test sample also included all B&B:08/09 field test interview nonrespondents, including those who 
were not NPSAS:08 interview respondents.1 The field test sample included a total of 1,590 sample 
members.2 Interviews were conducted between July 27, 2011 and October 7,  2011. 

1.2 

Instrumentation 
The content of the interview was based on previous interviews created for the 1993/03 

Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:93/03) and 2000/01 Baccalaureate and Beyond 
Longitudinal Study (B&B:2000/01) cohorts and on the B&B:08/09 interview, building on data 
elements developed with input from the study’s Technical Review Panel (TRP) and from NCES. 
Core data elements maintained in the B&B:08/12 field test interview included such items as degree 
attainment, continuing or graduate education, employment, debt and finances, family formation, 
civic engagement and volunteerism, and interest in or preparation for K–12 teaching. Additionally, 
information on teachers’ professional experiences was collected so as to permit a comparison of the 
teaching profession to other occupations as well as a general study of labor market outcomes for the 
cohort as a whole. The B&B:08/12 field test interview consisted of eight sections, grouped by topic: 
Eligibility, Undergraduate Education, Postbaccalaureate Education and Training, Postbaccalaureate 
Employment, K–12 Teaching, Student Background, Locating, and Opinions. 

Development of the B&B:08/12 interview included conducting cognitive interviews to 

provide feedback on the survey. A total of 24 cognitive interviews were conducted in March and 
April 2011. The cognitive interview process was designed to elicit respondent feedback to broad 
questions about terminology, experiences, and decisions related to their continued education, 
                                                 
1 The nonrespondents exclude students who were determined to be ineligible based on the interview or transcript. 
2 The numbers appearing in the tables, figures, and text of this report were rounded to the nearest 10 to maintain the confidentiality of study 
respondents. As a result, reported percentages (based on unrounded numbers) may differ somewhat from those that would result from these rounded 
numbers.

employment, and interest in and preparation for K–12 teaching. The 24 respondents were divided 
into three groups of particular interest: (1) currently enrolled students; (2) those who graduated with 
a bachelor’s degree in a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) field; and (3) 
those who had prepared for or who were interested in teaching at the K–12 level. The feedback 
helped to construct new items and refine current survey items.  

The field test instrument was designed as a mixed-mode instrument. A single web-based 

instrument was used for both self-administered interviews and interviewer-administered interviews. 
Although the use of mixed-mode data collection provides many benefits, it also introduces certain 
issues that must be considered to minimize mode effects. Several methodological features were built 
into the instrument to minimize mode effects, including help text on every form, telephone 
interviewer instructions on every form, pop-up messages when a response was entered in an 
incorrect format, and conversion text to encourage responses to critical items when sample 
members did not provide a response. 

The field test interview employed five interactive coding systems to standardize the 

collection of data on postsecondary institutions attended, major or field of study, occupation, 
employer industry, and any elementary or secondary schools where the respondent had taught. 
The reliability of responses to interview questions was evaluated through a reinterview 

containing 29 selected items from the main interview. Reinterviews were conducted approximately 3 
to 4 weeks after the initial interview and in the same administration mode as the initial interview. A 
subsample of approximately 320 interview respondents was randomly selected for reinterview to 
permit analysis of the reliability of the 29 items. 

1.3  Data Collection Systems 

The interview web instrument was developed using Hatteras, a web-based system developed 
by RTI in which project staff developed, reviewed, tested, modified, and communicated changes to 
specifications and code for the instrument. All information relating to the instrument was stored in 
an SQL Server database and was made accessible through web browser interfaces. Hatteras provided 
specification, programming, and testing interfaces for the B&B instrument. 

All aspects of the study were monitored using the Integrated Management System (IMS), a 
project management tool designed to give project staff and clients ready access to a repository of 
reports, critical project information, and deliverables. Daily reports and management information 
from all the major systems across the study resided in the IMS. The IMS contained the current 
project schedule, monthly progress reports, daily data collection reports and status reports, project 
plans and specifications, project deliverables, instrument specifications, a link to the instrumentation 
system, staff contacts, the project bibliography, and a document archive. 

The Receipt Control System (RCS) was used to control and monitor all activities related to 
data collection, including tracing and locating. Through RCS applications, project staff were able to 
perform such activities as e-mailing to groups of sample members, preparing lead letters and follow-
up mailings, executing batch tracing, reviewing locating information, tracking case status, and 
viewing telephone interviewer (TI) comments. The RCS was fully integrated with the Computer-
assisted telephone interviewing Case Management System (CATI-CMS) and Tracing Operations 
System (TOPS) so that all systems needing sample member data accessed a single database. Case 
status changes in the interview, CATI-CMS, or TOPS automatically triggered updates to RCS during 
overnight processes, providing integration between the data collection systems and the ability to 
identify problems early and implement solutions effectively.

B&B:08/12 Data File Documentation 

Appendix C. Field Test Report 

The CATI-CMS scheduled telephone calls to be made by TIs and tracked call outcomes. 

Within the CATI-CMS, TIs had the ability to send a reminder username/password e-mail to callers 
who chose to complete the interview via the Web and to initiate SMS text reminders to those who 
requested this service.  

TOPS was used to locate the sample members that CATI operators could not locate. TOPS 
allowed tracers to review all case data, including TI comments in the CATI-CMS, and to use various 
search methods to locate sample members.   

1.4  Experiments 

The B&B:08/12 field test included two instrumentation experiments. The first examined 

differences in the use of vertical and horizontal visual analog scales (VASs) in conjunction with real-
time feedback displays (RTFDs) compared to radio buttons without RTFDs. Results showed that 
item nonresponse did not vary significantly across the item types; however, the radio button version 
took the least time to complete. 

A second experiment compared radio buttons and VASs, without feedback displays. Four 

different item versions were tested: a 5-point slider with midpoints, a 10-point slider, 10-point radio 
button scales, and 5-point radio buttons with midpoints. There were no significant differences in 
response distributions or nonresponse across any of the layout options. 

Two data collection experiments were conducted during the B&B:08/12 field test. The first 
tested whether viewing a short informational video describing the study had any impact on response 
rates. Field test results indicated that those who received the video were not more likely to complete 
the survey instrument. The second data collection experiment evaluated the use of response 
propensity modeling to target cases with low likelihood of response, with the goal of improving 
weighted response rates and thereby minimizing nonresponse bias. Results showed that additional 
monetary incentives did increase response rates for the majority of the sample members, but not for 
those individuals near the highest and lowest propensity scores. Field test results did not show a 
reduction in bias as a result of the additional incentives offered to treatment cases. 

1.5  Planned Changes for the Full-Scale Study 

The final chapter of this report summarizes the changes planned for the B&B:08/12 full-
scale study, based on the results of the field test. Key changes for the full-scale study include the 
following: 

•  The employment section will be revised to prioritize completeness of job history over 

detail for specific jobs. 

•  Occupation coder results will be supplemented by external data matching. 
• 

In contrast to the a priori, propensity-based bias reduction approach tested in the field 
test, the full scale study will include an experiment that tests one group-level and one 
individual-level responsive design methodology in an effort to reduce nonresponse bias. 
Incentive amounts will be restructured so that those most likely to respond will be 
offered $20, those least likely to respond will be offered $55, and all others will be 
offered $35. Additionally, incentives may increase during the survey, based on the 
responsive design measures.

Chapter 2.  
Design and Outcomes 
This working paper describes the design, methodological procedures, and related evaluations 

for the 2008/12 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:08/12) field test. RTI 
International is conducting the B&B:08/12 field test data collection and subsequent full-scale study 
for the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) of the U.S. Department of Education’s 
Institute of Education Sciences (Contract No. ED-05-CO-0033). 

This chapter provides detail about the field test sampling design and procedures, interview 

design, data collection procedures, and the outcomes of the data collection. Unless otherwise 
indicated, a criterion probability level of .05 was used for all tests of significance conducted for the 
B&B:08/12 evaluations. Throughout this document, reported numbers of sample institutions and 
sample members have been rounded to ensure the confidentiality of the individual. As a result, row 
and column entries in tables may not sum to their respective totals, and reported percentages may 
differ somewhat from those that would result from these rounded numbers. 

2.1  Sampling 

This chapter describes the design of the B&B:08/12 field test sample, which has four stages. 

The first two stages occurred during The 2007–08 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study 
(NPSAS:08) field test study, when samples of NPSAS eligible institutions and students within 
institutions were selected. The third stage was in the first follow-up, when all confirmed and 
potential baccalaureate recipients from NPSAS:08 were included in the B&B:08/09 field test sample. 
The fourth stage is for the second follow-up, when all eligible sample members from B&B:08/09 (as 
determined by the B&B:08/09 interview and the transcripts) are included in the B&B:08/12 field 
test. 

This chapter describes the institution and student respondent universes. The steps used to 

select the institution and student samples for the base-year (NPSAS:08) field test, as well as the steps 
used in the NPSAS:08 and B&B:08/09 field tests to determine the B&B:08/09 and B&B:08/12 field 
test samples, respectively, are presented. 

2.1.1  Respondent Universe 

The respondent universe for the B&B:08/12 field test was identified using the same criteria 
and processes outlined in section 2.1 of the main report, with the exceptions that field test sample 
members  

•  consisted of students who completed requirements for a bachelor’s degree during the 

2006–07 academic year; and 

•  were identified from the NPSAS:08 and B&B:08/09 field tests.  
To be eligible for the NPSAS:08 field test, students had to be enrolled in a NPSAS eligible 

institution in any term or course of instruction at any time from July 1, 2006, through June 30, 2007. 
Students also had to meet the requirements identified in section 2.1 of the main report. 

B&B:08/12 Data File Documentation

Appendix C. Field Test Report 

2.1.2  Samples 

The B&B:08/12 field test student sample consisted of all B&B:08/09 field test eligible 

interview respondents, including those who were not NPSAS:08 interview respondents.1 All 
B&B:08/09 field test interview nonrespondents were also included in the B&B:08/12 field test 
sample, including those who were not NPSAS:08 interview respondents.2 The NPSAS:08 field test 
institution and student samples, and  B&B:08/09 and B&B:08/12 field test student samples, are 
described in this section. 

To be eligible for B&B, students had to complete requirements for a bachelor’s degree 
between July 1, 2006, and June 30, 2007. Given that institutions were asked to identify potential 
bachelor’s degree recipients before degree completion, the number of those who would actually 
complete their degree was expected to be lower. Therefore, NPSAS sampling rates for those 
identified by the sample institutions as potential baccalaureate recipients and other undergraduate 
students were adjusted to determine the expected sample sizes after accounting for expected false 
positives.3 The false positives experienced in NPSAS:2000 (the most recent NPSAS to include a B&B 
base-year cohort) were used to set appropriate sampling rates for the NPSAS:08 field test.4 

B&B:08/09 field test student sample. The total B&B:08/09 field test sample size was 

1,820. The NPSAS:08 field test yielded about 1,220 interview respondents who were confirmed to 
be bachelor’s degree recipients. The base-year sample also included about 600 interview 
nonrespondents who were either classified as potential bachelor’s degree recipients in the student 
institution records obtained through computer-assisted data entry (CADE) or were identified as 
such according to the initial classification by the NPSAS sample institution at the time of student 
sampling (prior to base-year data collection). Table 1 shows the distribution of the B&B sample, by 
NPSAS:08 interview response status and B&B eligibility.

B&B:08/12 field test student sample. The B&B:08/12 field test sample included 1,590 
sample members. To determine this sample size, the B&B:08/09 field test sample was the starting 
                                                 
1 The term “student” is used to refer to sample members, although at the time of the B&B:08/12 study, many of the sample members were not 
students.   
2 The nonrespondents exclude students who were determined to be ineligible based on the interview or transcript. 
3 False positives are students sampled as bachelor’s degree recipients who are not actually bachelor’s degree recipients.  
4 In NPSAS:2000, 13 percent of students identified by the sample institution as potential baccalaureate recipients at the time of sampling were later 
determined during the interview to be other undergraduate or graduate students. The false negative rate (percentage of students not sampled as 
bachelor’s degree recipients who are actually bachelor’s degree recipients) was 3 percent for those identified at the time of sampling as other 
undergraduate or graduate students but determined during the interview to be baccalaureate degree students. Given that potential baccalaureates were 
identified earlier in NPSAS:08 than in NPSAS:2000, a false positive rate of 15 percent was assumed for sampling purposes, and the false negative rate 
was ignored because it was expected to be minimal.

point, and ineligible and deceased cases were excluded. Ineligibles were determined in the 
B&B:08/09 interview or from the transcript. Table 2 shows the determination of the sample size. 
The distribution of this sample by prior response status is shown in table 3.  

Response rates among sample members who responded to the previous survey are generally 

expected to be high. However, the B&B:08/12 field test sample included some sample members 
who were nonrespondents to the first follow-up or the base-year study, or both, and experience 
suggested that the response rates among these sample members would be very low. Due to the 
limited amount of time to pursue difficult cases in the field test, the yield was expected to be at least 
900 interviews (a response rate of about 57 percent). The field test experiments (described in section 
3.2.5) provided an opportunity to evaluate whether nonresponse among prior-round 
nonrespondents, and the resulting bias, can be minimized.

Interview Design and Reinterview Analysis 
The purpose of the B&B:08/12 field test was to fully test all procedures, methods, and 

systems of the study in a realistic operational environment prior to implementing the full-scale study. 
This chapter provides an overview of the interview design and systems, data collection and 
outcomes, and an evaluation of the interview. 

2.2.1  Interview Design 

B&B:08/12 interview content was based on previous interviews created for B&B:93 and 

B&B:2000 cohorts and on the B&B:08/09 interview. The field test included data elements 
developed with input from the study’s Technical Review Panel (TRP) and from NCES. (See 
appendix A for a list of TRP members.) 

B&B:08/12 Data File Documentation 

C-9 

Appendix C. Field Test Report 

Core data elements maintained in the B&B:12 field test interview included degree 

attainment, continuing or graduate education, employment, debt and finances, family formation, 
volunteerism, and interest in or preparation for K–12 teaching. Additionally, information on 
teachers’ professional experiences was collected to allow a comparison of teaching professions with 
other occupations. Of particular relevance to B&B:08/12 are questions concerning whether U.S. 
colleges and universities are preparing enough graduates in the fields of science, technology, 
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and whether college graduates with training in these fields are 
using that training in the workplace or pursuing graduate education in STEM fields. Items to address 
these research questions were included in the B&B:08/12 field test. 

Development of the B&B:08/12 interview included conducting cognitive interviews to 

provide feedback on the survey. A total of 24 cognitive interviews were conducted in March and 
April 2011. The cognitive interview process was designed to elicit respondent feedback to broad 
questions about terminology, experiences, and decisions related to their continued education, 
employment, and interest and preparation for K–12 teaching. The 24 respondents were divided into 
three groups of particular interest: those enrolled in postbaccalaureate education, those who 
graduated with a bachelor’s degree in a STEM field, and those who had prepared for or were 
interested in teaching at the K–12 level. The feedback helped construct new items of interest and 
refine current survey items.  

Help text also aided in standardizing the data collected. Each question form in the survey 

included access to help text that provided details about interview questions and often provided 
definitions of unfamiliar terms contained in the questions or response options. Respondents could 
access help text by clicking on the button located under each question in the bottom center portion 
of the screen and, in some cases, by clicking on linked keywords in the item text (the results of the 
experiments are discussed in section 2.3). Pop-up messages were used to clarify any inconsistent or 
out-of-range values entered by respondents.  

Once the instrument was developed and programmed, rigorous testing was conducted. 

Project staff and NCES used mock scenarios to test the skip logic, question wording, screen layout, 
and overall efficiency of the instrument. To identify any potential problems, testing was done from a 
variety of locations, using a range of connection options, and at various times of day. The entire 
instrument development process was facilitated by the use of RTI’s Hatteras system (described in 
detail in section 1.3). The use of Hatteras allowed project staff to coordinate testing efforts with 
NCES. 

The reliability of responses to interview questions was evaluated through a reinterview 

containing 29 selected items from the main interview (described in section 3.5.4). Reinterviews were 
conducted approximately 3 to 4 weeks after the initial interview and generally in the same 
administration mode as the initial interview. To permit analysis of the reliability of the 29 items, a 
subsample of approximately 320 interview respondents was randomly selected for reinterview. 

2.2.2  Reinterview Analysis  

An important element of data quality in survey research is the reliability of self-reported 

responses to interview questions. One method of measuring reliability involves temporal stability, or 
how constant responses remain over time. That is, do the survey questions evoke the same 
responses from study members at time one and time two? To evaluate the reliability of responses 
collected in the B&B: 08/12 field test interview, a reinterview containing items selected from the 
main field test interview was developed. Items were selected for the reinterview because they were 

C-10 

B&B:08/12 Data File Documentation 

Appendix C. Field Test Report 

assumed to be temporally stable and most were newly designed or critical main interview items, or 
both. 

A random sample of about 320 respondents who had completed a full main interview was 
selected for reinterview. The reinterview sample was contacted beginning 3 weeks after completion 
of the main interview and asked to complete the reinterview. The interview was completed by 220 
respondents (69 percent).  

Sample members selected for reinterview were allowed to complete the reinterview either by 

web or by telephone. Of the 220 respondents who completed the reinterview, 150 (68 percent) 
completed by web and 70 (32 percent) completed by telephone. The majority of respondents who 
completed the initial interview by telephone also completed the reinterview by telephone (97 
percent). However, of those who completed the initial interview by web, approximately 19 percent 
switched modes and completed the reinterview by telephone (table 4).

Table 5 shows reliability estimates for the items included in the reinterview. For each item, 
the number of cases, percentage agreement between the interview and reinterview, and relational 
statistic are shown. For discrete items, percentage agreement was based on the extent to which 
responses to the initial interview matched exactly to the reinterview responses. For continuous 
items, responses were considered in agreement if the initial interview responses were within one 
standard deviation of the reinterview responses. 

The relational statistics quantified the strength of association between the pairs of items 

being compared; for each statistic, 1.00 was indicative of a perfect correlation (i.e., an exact match 
between the item on the initial interview and the same item on the reinterview for all respondents). 
The relational statistic, Cramer’s V, was used for items with discrete, unordered response categories 
(e.g., yes/no). Kendall’s tau-b (τb) estimated the relationship between items with ordered categories 
(e.g., excellent, fair, poor). Lastly, the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (r) was used 
for items with interval responses (e.g., salary).

Percentage agreement was generally high between the main interview and the reinterview. 
The five highest agreement items were in the Postbaccalaureate Education section, with agreement 
ranging from 95 percent to 98 percent. Three of the five items with the highest agreement were 
related to the types of financial aid the respondent received.  

The item with the lowest percentage agreement was in the Postbaccalaureate Education 
section, Stress from education related debt (43 percent). The low level of agreement for this item may 
indicate that the temporal component of the concept was vague; that is, respondents were not sure 
whether to answer based on their current level of stress or their overall level of stress. Asking about 
the respondent’s overall level of stress in the full-scale interview may increase the reliability of this 
item. The remaining items all have a percentage agreement higher than 80 percent.  

C-12 

B&B:08/12 Data File Documentation 

Appendix C. Field Test Report 

The highest agreement item in the Postbaccalaureate Employment section was Type of 
employer training in past year - remedial training (95 percent). The lowest agreement item was Type of 
employer training in past year - communication training (74 percent). Only four items in this section had a 
percentage agreement less than 80 percent. 

The item with the second lowest percentage agreement was Result of the sale of all major 

possessions (72 percent). The low relational statistic for this item (.52) also suggested that 
improvements to this question should be explored in the remaining cognitive interview sessions. 
The only other item in the Student Background section, Respondent has retirement account, had a 
percentage agreement of 91 percent. 

Overall, the results of the reinterview analysis indicate the survey was very reliable. The 

majority of items have a percentage agreement of 80 percent or higher. Only one item had a 
percentage agreement less than 70 percent.  

2.3  Experiments 

Several experiments were conducted as part of the B&B:08/12 field test. The purpose of 
these experiments was to inform the instrument design and data collection procedures for the full-
scale data collection. The following section discusses the design, implementation, and results of the 
instrumentation; data collection; and help text experiments conducted in the B&B:08/12 field test. 

2.3.1  Instrumentation Experiments 

Multiple instrumentation experiments were conducted in the B&B:08/12 field test. The first 
experiment examined differences in the use of vertical and horizontal visual analog scales (VASs) in 
conjunction with real-time feedback displays (RTFDs), compared to radio buttons without an 
RTFD. For these items the RTFD was a “bucket” that filled or emptied as the respondent moved a 
slider (figure 1). A second experiment compared radio buttons and VASs, both without feedback 
displays. 

Visual Analog Scales (VAS) Experiment. The use of horizontal and vertical VASs with 

real-time feedback was compared to radio buttons without real-time feedback for an item that 
collected data on the percentage of out-of-pocket educational expenses. There were two versions of 
the feedback display, one vertical and one horizontal. The results obtained from the VASs were 
compared to the results from the radio button version of the same question. The three question 
versions are shown in figure 1.

Item nonresponse does not vary significantly across the layout types, but the three versions 
produced significantly different distributions (table 6). Rank sums were significantly higher for the 
vertical slider and radio button versions compared to the horizontal slider, indicating that those who 
saw the horizontal layout reported a smaller percentage of out-of-pocket expenses (χ2 = 11.30, 
p < .001, χ2 = 8.12, p = .01). Response times for the vertical, horizontal, and radio button layouts 
were 29.3 seconds, 34.5 seconds, and 23.2 seconds, respectively. The radio button version took the 
least time to complete and was significantly faster than the horizontal bucket slider (t(297) = 3.79, 
p < .001).

Radio button experiment. A more general comparison of VASs and radio button layouts 

was also conducted. Four experimental item versions were evaluated in terms of response rates, 
response distributions, and time to complete: a 5-point slider with midpoints, a 10-point slider, a 
10-point radio button, and a 5-point radio button with midpoints. Figure 2 shows examples of the 
slider layouts, and figure 3 shows examples of radio button layouts.

There were no significant differences in the distribution of responses or item nonresponse 
when comparing the 5-point radio button to the 5-point slider. Similarly, there were no significant 
differences in distribution of responses when comparing the 10-point radio button to the 10-point 
slider.  

There were no significant differences in the amount of time it took to complete questions 
using a 5-point slider versus a 5-point radio button with midpoints; however, there were significant 
differences between the 10-point slider and the 10-point radio button, with the slider taking 
significantly longer than the radio button on the following forms: 

•  B12DJOBSAT01 – Job Satisfaction 
•  B12DNJYA01 – Job Satisfaction 
•  B12DPARSUP01 – Parental Support 
The average times for the 10-point slider version and the 10-point radio button versions of 

B12DJOBSAT01 were 36.7 seconds and 29.1 seconds, respectively (t(553) = 3.36, p< .001). The 
average times for the 10-point slider version and the 10-point radio button versions of 
B12DNJYA01 were 26.8 seconds and 19.2 seconds, respectively (t(553) = 3.66, p < .001). The 
average times for the 10-point slider version and the 10-point radio button versions of 
B12DPARSUP01 were 14.3 seconds and 11.8 seconds, respectively (t(461) = 2.16, p < .05). Timing 
information for each of the response layouts is shown in table 7.

2.3.2  Data Collection Experiments 

As part of the B&B:08/12 field test, the benefits of using a priori propensity scoring and 

incentive targeting to reduce nonresponse bias were evaluated. The method to estimate nonresponse 
bias and the variables used are described in appendix E. Nonresponse bias was computed once for 
all cases and again for all cases with low propensity cases treated as nonrespondents. Additionally, 
nonresponse bias was computed separately for 

•  high propensity cases; 
• 
low propensity cases; 
• 
low propensity cases in the control group; 
• 
low propensity cases in the experimental group; 
•  high propensity cases combined with low propensity control group cases; and 

B&B:08/12 Data File Documentation 

C-17 

Appendix C. Field Test Report 

•  high propensity cases combined with low propensity experimental group cases.  
The first two comparisons were to show if there was nonresponse bias due to low 

propensity cases, and the last two comparisons were to show if the response propensity experiment 
successfully reduced nonresponse bias among low propensity cases. Table 8 shows the results of the 
comparisons. None were statistically significant.

A second data collection experiment focused on a short YouTube video aimed at increasing 

response rates was also conducted. No difference was found in response rates between sample 
members who did and did not receive the informational video. 

2.3.3  Help Text Experiments  

Two experiments were conducted with the B&B:08/12 field test help text: (1) the impact of 

inline hyperlinks on help text use and (2) the impact of item-specific wording on the help text 
button versus generic wording. Item-specific wording included the phrase “Help with this question,” 
and the generic wording was “Help.”  

item-specific wording with a hyperlink;  
item-specific wording without a hyperlink; 

Respondents saw four possible combinations of the help text button experiment treatments:  
• 
• 
•  generic wording with a hyperlink; and 
•  generic wording without a hyperlink.  
Figure 4 shows the question with and without hyperlinks and the help text button with item-

specific and generic wording.

When hyperlinks were present, respondents were significantly more likely to access help text 

than when there were no hyperlinks. Table 9 shows the percentage of respondents accessing help 
text when a hyperlink was present and when it was not, within the two help text button formats. 
Within the item-specific wording treatment, the percentage of respondents accessing help text was 
35 percent when hyperlinks were present and 15 percent when they were not (χ2 = 29.77, p < .0001). 
Within the generic wording treatment, the percent of respondents accessing help text was 36 percent 
when hyperlinks were present and 9 percent when they were not (χ2 = 54.21, p < .0001). When 
hyperlinks were not present, respondents were significantly more likely to access help when they 
were presented with the item-specific wording versus the generic wording (χ2 = 4.44, p = .0351).

2.4  Recommendations for the Full-Scale Study 

The 2008/12 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:08/12) field test was 

conducted to test and evaluate study methods and results prior to implementation of the full-scale 
study. The following recommendations are based on the field test experience. 

B&B:08/12 Data File Documentation 

C-19 

Appendix C. Field Test Report 

B&B:08/12 full-scale sample. The B&B:08/12 full-scale sample will consist of all 

B&B:08/09 eligible respondents and all B&B:08/09 nonrespondents. The sample size will be 
17,160. The expected yield is about 14,500, given an expected eligibility rate of 95 percent among the 
B&B:08/09 nonrespondents and an expected 85 percent response rate. 

The B&B:08/09 full-scale study included 18,500 sample members and consisted of those 

who were confirmed to be baccalaureate recipients in the 2007–08 National Postsecondary Student 
Aid Survey (NPSAS:08) interview and also a subsample of potential baccalaureate recipients who 
were not interviewed in NPSAS:08. There were three types of nonrespondents in B&B:08/09: 

•  a sample member who responded to the NPSAS:08 interview but did not respond to the 

B&B:08/09 interview (referred to henceforth as a first follow-up nonrespondent); 

•  a sample member who did not respond to the NPSAS:08 interview but did respond to 

the B&B:08/09 interview (referred to henceforth as a base-year nonrespondent); and 
•  a sample member who did not respond to either the NPSAS:08 or B&B:08/09 

interviews (referred to henceforth as a double nonrespondent).  

Table 10 shows the distribution of the B&B:08/09 full-scale sample by prior response status.

Alternative sample designs were considered for the full-scale study, including subsampling 
first follow-up and double nonrespondents or excluding double nonrespondents. The decision to 
include all B&B:08/09 nonrespondents in the B&B:08/12 sample was reached after evaluating the 
implications of including, subsampling, or excluding nonrespondents. It was determined that 
including all nonrespondents may do the following: 

•  Be feasible, given the 35 percent response rate for double nonrespondents and the 49 
percent response rate for first follow-up nonrespondents in the B&B:08/12 field test; 

•  Help reduce the nonresponse bias that exists in the B&B:08/09 data; 
• 
• 
•  Be useful for future analyses using transcript data because there are transcript data for

•  Be beneficial for possible future follow-ups of the B&B:08/09 cohort; 
• 

Improve the variance over subsampling due to a potential increase in unequal weighting 
if subsampling were to be done; 

•  Affect the time, effort, and cost necessary to obtain interviews; and 
•  Reduce the overall response rate. 
Interview data collection. The field test data collection experience is used to inform plans 

for the full-scale study. Based on feedback from interviewing staff, the full-scale training protocol 
will be adjusted to include 

•  additional practice on the CATI-CMS; 
•  additional review of frequently asked questions,  
•  expanded training on conversational interviewing, and 
•  more detailed coverage of interviewer instructions.  
The full-scale study will continue to use previously proven tracing and locating methods and, 

possibly, a monetary incentive for participants who update their address.  

Electronic communications have proved to be an effective way to contact sample members. 

For the full-scale study, sample members will continue to receive postcards, e-mails, and text 
messages to remind them that they have been selected for the study, to provide easy access to the 
web survey, and to encourage their participation.  

Several experiments were conducted in the field test. A response propensity approach was 
evaluated to assess its ability to minimize nonresponse bias. Results demonstrated that the response 
propensity approach was not successful in reducing bias; however, higher incentives were 
significantly related to increased response for medium-propensity cases (i.e., those at the high end of 
the low-propensity range and those at the low end of the high-propensity range). These results 
suggest a three-tiered incentive structure for the full-scale study. Proposed incentive amounts are as 
follows:  

•  $20 to the highest-propensity cases (the top 30 percent);  
•  $35 to the medium-propensity group (the middle 40 percent); and 
•  $55 to the lowest-propensity cases (the bottom 30 percent). 
Due to the lack of success in reducing nonresponse bias in the field test, a revised 

nonresponse experiment will be carried out in the full-scale study. The revised experiment will 
evaluate the effectiveness of responsive design methodologies based on group and individual metrics 
that are intended to identify and strategically target the cases most likely to contribute to 
nonresponse bias.  

A field test experiment examined the effectiveness of an informational video describing the 

study on response rates. Results showed that the YouTube video did not increase response rates 
among those who viewed it; however, the video will be used in full-scale data collection to help 
capitalize on any effect that repeated exposures may have to positively influence response to future 
follow-up studies with this cohort.

Appendix C. Field Test Report 

The experiment comparing radio button to slider response options revealed no observable 

differences in response rates or response distributions; however, the radio button version took 
significantly less time to complete than the slider option. When comparing 10-point whole number 
scales to 5-point scales which allowed decimals (e.g., 2.5 points), once again, no differences in 
response distribution or response rates were seen, but whole number scales took less time to 
complete. Drawing from these results, the full-scale instrument scales will be 5-point radio buttons, 
with no decimals.  

An experiment designed to evaluate help text use compared help text access methods to 

identify those that resulted in the highest use. Respondents saw either a general or an item-specific 
help button at the bottom of the screen and, within those conditions, half of the respondents were 
provided with a hyperlink to the help text in the question wording. When help text was presented as 
a hyperlink within the question wording, respondents were significantly more likely to access the 
help text compared to when the hyperlinks were absent. In addition, when help text hyperlinks were 
not present, the item-specific button significantly increased the use of help text. Based on these 
results, the full-scale study will incorporate question wording with hyperlinks on selected terms and 
the item-specific button into the instrument.  

Generally, field test data indicated no substantial problems with the B&B:08/12 interview 
during data collection. However, revisions to specific questions in the field test interview will be 
made for the full-scale interview. These revisions are based on analysis of field test data, feedback 
from a Technical Review Panel meeting conducted in November 2011, and feedback from cognitive 
interviews with approximately 30 respondents.  

A major change to the full-scale instrument will involve the way employment history is 

collected. Employment data will be collected by employer, rather than by job. Respondents will be 
asked for their employer(s) and the starting and ending (or current) date(s), along with any periods 
of leave and the reason for the leave. The full-scale instrument will also collect the date of birth for 
all dependent children and dates of all marriages and divorces occurring since graduating from 
college. These changes are intended to capture a timeline of life events to help track changes that 
may correspond to educational and employment decisions in the years following graduation.  

Several forms were added in the K–12 Teaching section and others were reorganized or 
reworded in order to clarify the definition of a “teaching position” for respondents. With these 
changes, it is possible to include both components of a teaching position—the teacher type (e.g., 
regular classroom teacher) and school or district name (e.g., Smith High School)—in question 
wording throughout the teaching position loop.  

Administrative records matching recommendations. Administrative records matching 
procedures for the full-scale study will be very similar to procedures used in the field test for both 
the Central Processing System (CPS) and the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS). A 
match with the CPS database for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) data will 
occur for the 2010–11, 2011–12, and 2012-13 academic years. Students will likely be matched with 
the NSLDS database for federal loan and Pell Grant data at three different times during data 
collection. Two interim matches to obtain preliminary data and a final match prior to data delivery 
will be performed. 

In addition to matching with CPS and NSLDS, the full-scale study will include 

administrative records matches with National Student Clearinghouse (NSC) for enrollment and 
degree data. The match with NSC will occur near the end of data collection.

Data file editing and preparation recommendations. Full-scale survey data will be 

edited, processed, and prepared for delivery in a manner similar to the procedures described for the 
field test. There are no revisions required for the full-scale plans based on the field test experience. 
Alternative coding methods are being evaluated in an attempt to reduce respondent burden and 
improve accuracy. The full-scale data collection may include components that permit the evaluation 
of those alternatives in more detail.

information from you and others like you who graduated from college during the 2007–08 school year.  
Data collected from B&B will help educators, researchers, and policymakers better understand how 
earning a bachelor’s degree impacts choices about further education and work.  This is the second round 
of B&B. Whether or not you have participated in prior rounds of B&B, your participation now is critically 
important.  
When B&B data collection begins in August 2012, you will receive a letter in a large white envelope that 
will provide specific information about how to participate.  The letter will explain that if you complete 
the approximately 35-minute survey on the Web by the date indicated, you will receive $«incamt» as 
a token of our appreciation.  In the meantime, we need to update our contact information for you.  
Please help us now by providing your mailing address, telephone number(s), and e-mail address(es) 
online at https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/bb/.  You will also find out more about B&B at this website.  As a 
token of our appreciation for providing your contact information, you will receive $10.

NOTE: Respondents entered a text string describing 
the job title and duties of the job held prior to the 
2011–12 school year, then selected an occupation using 
the occupation coder built into the instrument. In some 
cases, respondents did not select an occupation in the 
coder. Survey contractor staff attempted to code these 
text strings and when they were able to do so, this flag 
was set to 1. Some occupations that were coded by 
respondents were randomly selected for a recoding 
review by survey contractor staff. In the event that the 
occupation was recoded to a new value, this flag was 
set to 1. If the flag was set to 1, the following variables

school using the elementary/secondary school coder 
built into the instrument. In some cases, respondents 
did not select a school in the coder. Survey contractor 
staff 
attempted to code these schools and when they were 
able to do so, this flag was set to 1.

1 DEFT is the square root of DEFF and can also be defined as the ratio of the design-based standard error over the standard error that would 
have been obtained from a simple random sample of the same size (if that were practical). 
2 DEFF is the survey design effect for a statistic and is defined as the ratio of the design-based variance estimate over the variance estimate 
that would have been obtained from a simple random sample of the same size (if that were practical). 
NOTE: Responses that include logical skips, not applicable, missing, unknown, or multiple possible answers were excluded from analysis.

2 DEFF is the survey design effect for a statistic and is defined as the ratio of the design-based variance estimate over the variance estimate 
that would have been obtained from a simple random sample of the same size (if that were practical). 
NOTE: Responses that include logical skips, not applicable, missing, unknown, or multiple possible answers were excluded from analysis.

1 DEFT is the square root of DEFF and can also be defined as the ratio of the design-based standard error over the standard error that would 
have been obtained from a simple random sample of the same size (if that were practical). 
2 DEFF is the survey design effect for a statistic and is defined as the ratio of the design-based variance estimate over the variance estimate 
that would have been obtained from a simple random sample of the same size (if that were practical). 
NOTE: Responses that include logical skips, not applicable, missing, unknown, or multiple possible answers were excluded from analysis.

1 DEFT is the square root of DEFF and can also be defined as the ratio of the design-based standard error over the standard error that would 
have been obtained from a simple random sample of the same size (if that were practical). 
2 DEFF is the survey design effect for a statistic and is defined as the ratio of the design-based variance estimate over the variance estimate 
that would have been obtained from a simple random sample of the same size (if that were practical).

1 DEFT is the square root of DEFF and can also be defined as the ratio of the design-based standard error over the standard error that would 
have been obtained from a simple random sample of the same size (if that were practical). 
2 DEFF is the survey design effect for a statistic and is defined as the ratio of the design-based variance estimate over the variance estimate 
that would have been obtained from a simple random sample of the same size (if that were practical). 
NOTE: Responses that include logical skips, not applicable, missing, unknown, or multiple possible answers were excluded from analysis.

1 DEFT is the square root of DEFF and can also be defined as the ratio of the design-based standard error over the standard error that would 
have been obtained from a simple random sample of the same size (if that were practical). 
2 DEFF is the survey design effect for a statistic and is defined as the ratio of the design-based variance estimate over the variance estimate 
that would have been obtained from a simple random sample of the same size (if that were practical). 
NOTE: Responses that include logical skips, not applicable, missing, unknown, or multiple possible answers were excluded from analysis.

1 DEFT is the square root of DEFF and can also be defined as the ratio of the design-based standard error over the standard error that would 
have been obtained from a simple random sample of the same size (if that were practical). 
2 DEFF is the survey design effect for a statistic and is defined as the ratio of the design-based variance estimate over the variance estimate 
that would have been obtained from a simple random sample of the same size (if that were practical). 
NOTE: Responses that include logical skips, not applicable, missing, unknown, or multiple possible answers were excluded from analysis.

1 DEFT is the square root of DEFF and can also be defined as the ratio of the design-based standard error over the standard error that would 
have been obtained from a simple random sample of the same size (if that were practical). 
2 DEFF is the survey design effect for a statistic and is defined as the ratio of the design-based variance estimate over the variance estimate 
that would have been obtained from a simple random sample of the same size (if that were practical). 
NOTE: Responses that include logical skips, not applicable, missing, unknown, or multiple possible answers were excluded from analysis.

1 DEFT is the square root of DEFF and can also be defined as the ratio of the design-based standard error over the standard error that would 
have been obtained from a simple random sample of the same size (if that were practical). 
2 DEFF is the survey design effect for a statistic and is defined as the ratio of the design-based variance estimate over the variance estimate 
that would have been obtained from a simple random sample of the same size (if that were practical). 
NOTE: Responses that include logical skips, not applicable, missing, unknown, or multiple possible answers were excluded from analysis.

1 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using base weight adjusted for subsampling) and the mean of all sample cases (using the base 
weight adjusted for subsampling). 
2 Relative bias is defined as the ratio of estimated bias to the weighted mean of the full sample. 
3 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the product of the base weighted nonresponse rate and the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using base weight adjusted for 
subsampling) and the mean of nonrespondent cases (using the base weight adjusted for subsampling). 
4 Base weight, adjusted for subsampling and nonresponse. 
5 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using the specified weight) and the mean of all sample cases (using the specified weight).

1 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using base weight adjusted for subsampling) and the mean of all sample cases (using the base 
weight adjusted for subsampling). 
2 Relative bias is defined as the ratio of estimated bias to the weighted mean of the full sample. 
3 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the product of the base weighted nonresponse rate and the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using base weight adjusted for 
subsampling) and the mean of nonrespondent cases (using the base weight adjusted for subsampling). 
4 Base weight, adjusted for subsampling and nonresponse. 
5 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using the specified weight) and the mean of all sample cases (using the specified weight).

‡ Row is suppressed. Contains less than five unweighted nonrespondents. 
* p < .05 
1 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using base weight adjusted for subsampling) and the mean of all sample cases (using the base 
weight adjusted for subsampling). 
2 Relative bias is defined as the ratio of estimated bias to the weighted mean of the full sample. 
3 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the product of the base weighted nonresponse rate and the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using base weight adjusted for 
subsampling) and the mean of nonrespondent cases (using the base weight adjusted for subsampling). 
4 Base weight, adjusted for subsampling and nonresponse. 
5 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using the specified weight) and the mean of all sample cases (using the specified weight). 
6 New England = Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont; Mideast = Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania; Great 
Lakes = Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin; Plains = Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota; Southeast = Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, 
Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia; Southwest = Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas; Rocky Mountains = Colorado, Idaho, Montana, 
Utah, Wyoming; Far West = Alaska, California, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, Washington. 
7 Categories were defined by quartiles. Stafford Loan amount category was collapsed. 
NOTE: PLUS = Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.

1 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using base weight adjusted for subsampling) and the mean of all sample cases (using the base 
weight adjusted for subsampling). 
2 Relative bias is defined as the ratio of estimated bias to the weighted mean of the full sample. 
3 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the product of the base weighted nonresponse rate and the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using base weight adjusted for 
subsampling) and the mean of nonrespondent cases (using the base weight adjusted for subsampling). 
4 Base weight, adjusted for subsampling and nonresponse. 
5 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using the specified weight) and the mean of all sample cases (using the specified weight).

1 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using base weight adjusted for subsampling) and the mean of all sample cases (using the base 
weight adjusted for subsampling). 
2 Relative bias is defined as the ratio of estimated bias to the weighted mean of the full sample. 
3 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the product of the base weighted nonresponse rate and the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using base weight adjusted for 
subsampling) and the mean of nonrespondent cases (using the base weight adjusted for subsampling). 
4 Base weight, adjusted for subsampling and nonresponse. 
5 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using the specified weight) and the mean of all sample cases (using the specified weight).

1 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using base weight adjusted for subsampling) and the mean of all sample cases (using the base 
weight adjusted for subsampling). 
2 Relative bias is defined as the ratio of estimated bias to the weighted mean of the full sample. 
3 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the product of the base weighted nonresponse rate and the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using base weight adjusted for 
subsampling) and the mean of nonrespondent cases (using the base weight adjusted for subsampling). 
4 Base weight, adjusted for subsampling and nonresponse. 
5 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using the specified weight) and the mean of all sample cases (using the specified weight).

‡ Row is suppressed. Contains less than five unweighted nonrespondents. 
* p < .05 
1 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using base weight adjusted for subsampling) and the mean of all sample cases (using the base 
weight adjusted for subsampling). 
2 Relative bias is defined as the ratio of estimated bias to the weighted mean of the full sample. 
3 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the product of the base weighted nonresponse rate and the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using base weight adjusted for 
subsampling) and the mean of nonrespondent cases (using the base weight adjusted for subsampling). 
4 Base weight, adjusted for subsampling and nonresponse. 
5 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using the specified weight) and the mean of all sample cases (using the specified weight).

Table J-8.  Student nonresponse bias for analysis weight 2 (panel) before and after weight adjustments, by select variables for students 

in for-profit institutions: 2012—Continued 

‡ Row is suppressed. Contains less than five unweighted nonrespondents. 
* p < .05 
1 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using base weight adjusted for subsampling) and the mean of all sample cases (using the base 
weight adjusted for subsampling). 
2 Relative bias is defined as the ratio of estimated bias to the weighted mean of the full sample. 
3 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the product of the base weighted nonresponse rate and the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using base weight adjusted for 
subsampling) and the mean of nonrespondent cases (using the base weight adjusted for subsampling). 
4 Base weight, adjusted for subsampling and nonresponse. 
5 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using the specified weight) and the mean of all sample cases (using the specified weight). 
6 New England = Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont; Mideast = Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania; Great 
Lakes = Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin; Plains = Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota; Southeast = Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, 
Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia; Southwest = Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas; Rocky Mountains = Colorado, Idaho, Montana, 
Utah, Wyoming; Far West = Alaska, California, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, Washington. 
7 Categories were defined by quartiles. 
NOTE: PLUS = Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.

1 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using base weight adjusted for subsampling) and the mean of all sample cases (using the base 
weight adjusted for subsampling). 
2 Relative bias is defined as the ratio of estimated bias to the weighted mean of the full sample. 
3 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the product of the base weighted nonresponse rate and the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using base weight adjusted for 
subsampling) and the mean of nonrespondent cases (using the base weight adjusted for subsampling). 
4 Base weight, adjusted for subsampling and nonresponse. 
5 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using the specified weight) and the mean of all sample cases (using the specified weight).

1 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using base weight adjusted for subsampling) and the mean of all sample cases (using the base 
weight adjusted for subsampling). 
2 Relative bias is defined as the ratio of estimated bias to the weighted mean of the full sample. 
3 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the product of the base weighted nonresponse rate and the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using base weight adjusted for 
subsampling) and the mean of nonrespondent cases (using the base weight adjusted for subsampling). 
4 Base weight, adjusted for subsampling and nonresponse. 
5 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using the specified weight) and the mean of all sample cases (using the specified weight).

* p < .05 
1 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using base weight adjusted for subsampling) and the mean of all sample cases (using the base 
weight adjusted for subsampling). 
2 Relative bias is defined as the ratio of estimated bias to the weighted mean of the full sample. 
3 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the product of the base weighted nonresponse rate and the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using base weight adjusted for 
subsampling) and the mean of nonrespondent cases (using the base weight adjusted for subsampling). 
4 Base weight, adjusted for subsampling and nonresponse. 
5 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using the specified weight) and the mean of all sample cases (using the specified weight).

Table J-12. Student nonresponse bias for analysis weight 3 (transcript panel) before and after weight adjustments, by select variables 

for students in for-profit institutions: 2012—Continued 

‡ Row is suppressed. Contains less than five unweighted nonrespondents. 
* p < .05 
1 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using base weight adjusted for subsampling) and the mean of all sample cases (using the base 
weight adjusted for subsampling). 
2 Relative bias is defined as the ratio of estimated bias to the weighted mean of the full sample. 
3 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the product of the base weighted nonresponse rate and the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using base weight adjusted for 
subsampling) and the mean of nonrespondent cases (using the base weight adjusted for subsampling). 
4 Base weight, adjusted for subsampling and nonresponse. 
5 Bias in the sample mean is estimated as the difference between the mean of respondent cases (using the specified weight) and the mean of all sample cases (using the specified weight). 
6 New England = Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont; Mideast = Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania; Great 
Lakes = Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin; Plains = Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota; Southeast = Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, 
Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia; Southwest = Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas; Rocky Mountains = Colorado, Idaho, Montana, 
Utah, Wyoming; Far West = Alaska, California, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, Washington. 
7 Categories were defined by quartiles. 
NOTE: PLUS = Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.

Abstract 
Boards  of  Managements  (B.O.M)  carry  with  them  the  success  or  failure  of  the  schools’  management.    The 
success  of  B.O.M  is  portrayed  through  good  academic  performance  and  high  discipline  standards  in  schools. 
Poor  management  on  the  other  hand,  may  lead  to  the  dissolution  of  the  Board  and  nomination  of  another  to 
manage the school. Performance of the B.O.M may be as a result of their training levels and acquired skills. This 
study  therefore  sought  to  categorize  education  levels  of  B.O.M  in  Wareng  Sub  County  in  relation  to  their 
involvement in the recruitment process.  The study employed a descriptive survey design. The study population 
included head teachers/principals, members of Board of Managements, Education Officers, teachers and Support 
Staff. Simple random sampling was used to obtain 12 schools out of the total 24 public schools in Wareng Sub 
County.  A  total  of  12  head  teachers,  7  school  bursars  and  three  District  Education  Officers  were  purposively 
included in the study. Simple random sampling was used to select 50 teachers and 43 B.O.M members from the 
schools selected. Data was collected by the use of questionnaires and interview schedules and analysed by use of 
descriptive statistics.  The study established that majority of the B.O.M members were holders of Diploma and 
Secondary  Education  Certificate.  It  was  also  established  that  B.O.M  were  often  engaged  in  the  selection  of 
teachers and recruitment of non- teaching staff, promotion and discipline of support staff, motivation of teachers 
and  disciplining  of  errant  teachers.  The  study  is  expected  to  enrich  Board  of  Management’s    induction  and 
training programmes in order to improve the quality of school management in Wareng Sub County.  
Keywords: Relationship, Board of Management, Recruitment, Public Secondary Schools, Education level.  
 
1. Introduction  
According to Ominde report (1964) the establishment of B.O.M is aimed at giving each school a personality of 
its  own  and  it  is  also  a  means  of  decentralization  of  authority  to  avoid  delays  and  impersonal  nature  of  the 
Central Government. Section 4 (1) (b) of the Teacher’s Service Commission (TSC) Act, allows the commission 
to  delegate  functions  in  matters  related  to  recruitment,  assignment,  transfers  and  discipline  of  teachers  to  the 
TSC agent; the B.O.M for that matter. The big question is whether the agents are adequately prepared to handle 
teacher and non-teaching staff recruitment and selection within the decentralized framework. 

In  Africa,  different  countries  have  different  experiences  and  practices  as  well  as  views      on  the 
involvement of Board of Management in the recruitment and selection of personnel in secondary schools. Vain 
Wyk (2001) carried out research to establish factors influencing the implementation of school governing bodies 
in post  Apartheid South  Africa. Using  survey research design, the author targeted parents, teachers and school 
principals in South  Africa. The study revealed that  governing bodies’ performance  was  greatly undermined by 
lack of adequate training of board members. It also indicated that schools principals were reluctant to relinquish 
or  even  share  power  and  authority  with  the  governing  bodies.  The  study  revealed  that  many  school  governing 
bodies were not representative of the ethnic, color and class diversity. In the Kenyan situation it is important to 
find out  whether ethnicity, religious affiliation and class affect the performance of the Boards of Management. 
The guidelines on the qualification and composition of the Boards of Management  may  help to reveal existing 
disparities  in  the  composition  of  membership.  The  above  findings  instigated  the  current  study  to  establish  the 
relationship  between  involvement  of  BOM  in  recruitment  and  selection  of  personnel  in  secondary  schools  and 
their levels of training. 

Wangatho (2000) carried out a study of stakeholders’ perception of effectiveness in B.O.M steering of 
Public Secondary Schools in Ol-Kalou and Ol-Joro Orok Division of Nyandarua District. He recommended that 
all  those  managing  secondary  schools  should  undergo  training  before  they  are  assigned  managerial  duties.  He 
also proposed that B.O.M should be involved in all areas of management as stipulated in the Education Act and 
only in some aspects. It was a concern for this study to investigate whether training for new board members is 
taking place in Kenya today. 
 
1.1  Training, Recruitment, Development and Performance Appraisal 
Training is the process of providing junior employees with specific knowledge and skills in order to enable them

to  perform  specific  tasks.  Development  on  the  other  hand  is  the  process  of  providing  senior  employees  with 
conceptual  skills  for  performing  general  duties.  Okumbe  (1998)  asserts  that  the  purposes  of  training  are  to 
improve employees’ performance in their current jobs and/or equip them for more demanding roles or change in 
their  tasks  in  future.  Lack  of  training  causes  underperformance,  low  job  morale  and  high  turnover  as  workers 
become increasingly frustrated for not being able to perform the work as expected. 

Education management has no choice as whether to train employees or not. All employees, regardless 
of  their  previous  training,  education  and  experience  must  be  given  further  training  and  development.  This  is 
because the competence of  workers  will never last forever due to such factors as curriculum and technological 
changes, transfers and promotions. As a result of training employees become more flexible. The productivity and 
quality of  work improves. There is job satisfaction  with reduced absenteeism, staff turn-over and  work related 
accidents.  The  organization  also  learns  not  to  fear  new  technology  and  other  changes.  Currently  schools  are 
adapting  to  Information  Computer  Technology  in  education  and  all  employees  ought  to  be  compliant. 
Management  recruitment  seeks  to  improve  a  person’s  overall  career  prospects  rather  than  train  him  or  her  to 
perform  duties  necessary  for  the  present  job.  It  comprises  of  a  series  of  planned  training  activities  and  work 
experiences designed to improve a manager’s performance and equip him or her for higher level work.  

Training for Board of Management may include administrative procedures, legal aspects, management 
methods, time management, interpersonal skills, communication, leadership, creative abilities, decision making 
and  problem  solving.  The  present  study  sought  to  establish  the  level  of  education  which  involves  training  of 
B.O.M.  and their involvement in the recruitment process. 

Performance  appraisal  refers  to  the  evaluation  of  the  effectiveness  of  workers  in  their  work 
assignments.  It  is  aimed  at  finding  out  the  potentials  of  an  individual  employee.  It  helps  to  evaluate  how  a 
worker succeeds in his/her present job and this is important for estimating how well he or she will perform in the 
future. It helps to determine the strengths and weaknesses of an individual worker so that remedial measures can 
be taken to improve productivity. It enables the management to determine training needs and provides basis for 
promotion and internal recruitment, transfers or dismissals. It helps in increasing job satisfaction of workers by 
developing their potentials through proper feedback mechanisms. It is also an important tool for human resource 
planning in an education organization. It is an important source of feedback on the effectiveness of selection and 
training.  

Performance management is the integration of employee recruitment with results based assessment. It 
encourages  performance  appraisal,  objective  setting  for  individuals  and  departments,  appropriate  training 
programmes. Appraisal of  managers by their subordinate, peers and people in other departments  might also be 
included  in  the  scheme.  Managers  need  to  constantly  monitor  the  external  environment  for  opportunities  and 
threats affecting  human resources and be prepared to react quickly to these changes.  Cardy, Gomez-Meija and 
Balkin (2005) state that major considerations include workforce diversity, legislation globalization, competitive 
forces, labour unions and epidemics. Many human resource departments organize diversity training, workshops 
for managers and employees to enable them to better their skills.  

It  is  important  for  mangers  to  monitor  legal  environments  and  develop  internal  systems  such  as 
supervisory  training  and  grievance  procedures  to  avoid  costly  legal  battles.  The  board  should  be  familiar  with 
documents like the employment acts, labour dispute acts, children rights and the affirmative actions that aim to 
accomplish the goal of fair employment by making efforts to employ members of protected classes like women, 
children and the handicapped. 
 
2. Materials and Methods 
This  study  employed  descriptive  survey  research  design  since  the  factors  investigated  and  data  collection 
procedures  were  descriptive  in  nature.  According  to  Koul  (1984),  descriptive  studies  are  classified  into  three 
categories; survey studies, interrelationship studies and developmental studies. The design was adopted because 
the  population  studied  was  too  large  to  be  observed  directly  and  thus  economically  viable  both  in  time  and 
money by taking a sample of population to generalize results for the whole population, resulting to in-depth, rich 
and  meaningful  findings.  The  study  was  carried  out  in  Wareng  Sub  County,  Uasin  Gishu  County,  Kenya. 
Wareng  Sub  County  has  forty  (40)  public  secondary  schools  among  them  four  (4)  provincial  girls  boarding 
schools (GB) and one (1) provincial boys boarding school (BB), thirty five (35) district schools of which, one (1) 
is purely boys boarding, one (1) is boarding for boys and day for girls, another is boarding for girls and day for 
boys the remaining thirty two are day mixed schools. 

The  Sub  County  also  has  nine  (9)  private  schools  but  the  study  was  only  concerned  with  the  public 
secondary schools. All the provincial schools have a maximum capacity of five hundred and forty (540) students; 
all the district schools have a maximum capacity of two thousand and seventy (2070) (D.E.O’S Office- Wareng 
Sub County, 2008). There are seven hundred and sixty five (765) private schools.  The subject of the study was 
from  the  twenty  four  (24)  public  schools  that  presented  candidates  for  the  Kenya  Certificate  of  Secondary 
Education (KCSE, 2008). The study also targeted Wareng District Education Officer, the staffing officer, head

teachers, teachers, B.O.M. members and non- teaching staff members. 

The  author  used  simple  random  sampling  to  obtain  12  schools  which  represented  50%  of  the  total 
number  of  schools.  This  agrees  with  Kerlinger  (1986)  who  noted  that  a  sample  size  of  at  least  30%  is  a  good 
representation of the entire population. Simple random sampling was also used to obtain 48 board members out 
of 168 (four from each school) and 50 teachers out of 167 from the selected schools. All the twelve head teachers 
from the twelve schools, the three education officers from the District Education Officer, the staffing officer and 
school bursars  were purposively included in this  study. The study  used questionnaires and interview schedules 
for  data  collection.  Data  collected  through  questionnaires  was  analyzed  using  descriptive  statistical  techniques 
which included frequencies and percentages, whereas data from the interview was recorded qualitatively under 
the respective themes. Quantitative data was presented in tables. 

 
3. Results 
3.1 Demographic Information 
Background  information  of  the  respondents  was  considered  important  because  generalization  and  conclusions 
are largely drawn on the basis of characteristics of the respondents, their attitudes and experiences. 
 
3.2 Respondents’ Gender 
The  teachers,  B.O.G,  respondents  who  participated  in  this  study  were  required  to  state  their  gender.  Their 
responses are presented in Table 1.

As shown in Table 1, majority (64%) of the teachers who participated in this study were male whereas the rest 
(36%) were female. Majority (76.7 %) of the B.O.M members were male whereas the rest (23.3%) were female. 
This implies that there was gender imbalance of B.O.M in the schools selected for this study. It is also instructive 
to note that 71.4% of the bursars who participated in this study were female and the remaining 28.6% were male. 
This is an indication that most schools have an inclination towards employment of female bursars. 
 
3.3 Length of Stay in School  
Apart from academic qualification of the teachers who participated in this study, the other variable included in 
this  study  was  the  length  of  stay  of  the  teachers  in  the  schools.  Table  2  shows  the  teachers’  responses  on  this 
item. 
 
Table 2: Length of Stay in School

It is indicated in Table 2 that 50% (25) of the teachers had stayed in their work stations for a period of less than 3 
years. Another 22% (11) had been in the station for a period ranging between 4 and 6 years. It is further revealed 
that 16% (8) had been in the stations for more than ten years thus more qualified to give meaningful responses to 
the items in the research instruments. It should be noted that 12% (6) of the teachers had taught for a period of 
between 7-9 years. This implies that most of the teachers had worked in the station for more than a year hence 
they could provide up to date information about the school. 
 
3.4 Academic Qualification  
The study sought to establish the academic qualification of the respondents who were included in this study. This 
data  would  enable  the  author  to  identify  the  quality  of  teachers  and  bursars  recruited  by  the  B.O.Gs  in  the 
schools selected for this study.  This variable was important for this study to establish the education level of the 
B.O.G members and thus their ability to participate in the recruitment and selection process. The findings on this

Table  3  shows  that  64  %  (32)  of  the  teachers  were  holders  of  a  degree  in  education  and  18%  (9)  had  Masters 
Degrees.  It  is  also  shown  that  16  %  (8)  possessed  a  Diploma  in  Education  and  only  2%  (1)  were  unqualified. 
This implies that majority of the teachers were qualified and thus able to teach in secondary schools. These are 
some  of  the  teachers  recruited  by  the  B.O.M  at  the  secondary  school  level.  A  fraction  of  37.2%  (16)  of  the 
B.O.M members had secondary school education as their highest academic qualification and 27.9 % (12) were 
Diploma holders. Another 20.9% (9) were Degree holders. The Table also indicates that 9.3% (4) of the B.O.M 
members  had  a  Masters  Degree  as  their  highest  academic  qualification.  It  should  be  noted  that  4.7%  (2)  of 
B.O.M  members  had  primary  school  education  as  their  highest  academic  qualification.    B.O.M  members  with 
primary education as their highest qualification are  a breach to guidelines. This implies that a majority (65.1%) 
of  the  B.O.M  members  were  diploma  and  secondary  education  holders.  Most  (42.8%)  of  the  bursars  were 
holders of KATC II whereas 28.6% were KATC I. Only 14.3% were CPA holders. From the interview results, it 
was established that all the head teachers were B.E.D degree holders and majority had been in the district for a 
period of 1-3 years. This implies that they had relevant information for this study. 
 
3.5 Teachers’ views of the Recruitment and Selection Exercise 
The study also sought to determine the level of involvement of Boards of Management in personnel recruitment. 
To achieve this objective, teachers were asked to state their views concerning the conduct of recruitment exercise 
in their respective schools. Their responses are as shown in Table 4.

As revealed in Table 4, 44 % (22) of the teachers agreed that the recruitment of teachers should remain 
under B.O.M whereas 48% (24) disagreed. Another 8% (4) were undecided on this variable and thus they did not 
give  their  comment  concerning  this  item.  It  is  further  revealed  that  78  %  (39)  of  the  teachers  asserted  that  the 
recruitment process should be streamlined to make it more effective whereas 18% (9) disagreed and only 4% (92) 
were undecided. This implies that the recruitment process required to be streamlined to increase its effectiveness. 
It is also indicated that 50% (25) of the teachers said that B.O.M involvement in the recruitment exercise should 
be  scrapped  whereas  34%  (17)  disagreed.  This  implies  that  a  half  of  the  teachers  suggested  that  B.O.M 
involvement in the recruitment process should be scrapped. 

Table  4  also  indicates  that  64%  (32)  of  the  teachers  who  participated  in  this  study  agreed  that  the 
recruitment  process  was  prone  to  manipulation  and  20%  (10)  disagreed  whereas  the  remaining  16%  (8)  were 
undecided on this item. A report by the commission of enquiry into education system in Kenya (1999) expressed

concern on the political influence in the appointment of B.O.M members, low level of Education for some and 
lack of commitment for others. There were 42% (21) of the teachers who asserted that B.O.M members were not 
competent  to  handle  the  recruitment  exercise  and  40%  (20)  disagreed.  Only  18%  (9)  were  undecided.  Ogono 
(1987)  revealed  that  role  conflict  between  the  head  teacher  and  the  B.O.M  was  mainly  because  the  B.O.M 
members were not adequately knowledgeable on their duties and powers. It is further revealed that 48% (24) of 
the  teachers  agreed  that  selection  was  based  on  merit  while  36%  disagreed  and  another  16%  (8)  remained 
undecided on this item. 

 

4. Discussion 
4.1 Demographic Information 
The study sought to establish the gender, academic qualification and experience of the respondents. The findings 
of the study indicates that majority (64%) of the teachers who participated in this study were male whereas the 
rest  (36%)  were  female.  It  was  found  that  76.7  %  of  the  B.O.M  members  were  male  whereas  (23.3%)  were 
female. Further, 71.4% of the bursars who participated in this study were female and the remaining 28.6% were 
male.  Concerning  the  academic  qualification  of  the  respondents,  it  was  established  that  64  %  of  the  teachers 
were holders of a degree in education and 18% (9) had Masters Degrees. It is also shown that 16 %( 8) possessed 
a diploma in education and only 2% (1) were unqualified. As for the B.O.M members, a majority (65.1%) of the 
B.O.M  members  were  diploma  and  secondary  education  holders.  Most  (42.9%) of  the  bursars  were  holders  of 
KATC II whereas 28.6% had KATC I as their highest level of education. Only 14.3% were CPA holders.  
 
4.2 Teachers’ Opinions on the Recruitment Exercise 
The study revealed that 44 % of the teachers agreed that the recruitment of teachers should remain under B.O.M 
whereas  48%  disagreed.  Another  78  %  asserted  that  the  recruitment  process  should  be  streamlined  to  make  it 
more  effective  whereas  18%  disagreed.  It  was  also  indicated  that  50%  of  the  teachers  said  that  B.O.M 
involvement in the recruitment exercise should be scrapped whereas 34% disagreed. It was agreed by 64% of the 
teachers  that  the  recruitment  process  was  prone  to  manipulation  and  20%  disagreed.  There  were  42%  of  the 
teachers  who  asserted  that  B.O.M  members  were  not  competent  to  handle  the  recruitment  exercise  and  40% 
disagreed. It was further revealed that 48% of the teachers agreed that selection was based on merit while 36% 
disagreed.  
 
5. Conclusion 
From  the  study  findings,  a  conclusion  can  be  drawn  that  there  is  gender  disparity  in  Board  of  Management 
membership. The study also found that Board of Management members are fairly educated; but they need policy 
documents, and capacity building to cope with emerging issues.

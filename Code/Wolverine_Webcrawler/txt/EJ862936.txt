Past research has demonstrated emergent conditional relations using a go/no-go procedure with
pairs of figures displayed side-by-side on a computer screen. The present study sought to extend
applications of
this procedure. In Experiment 1, we evaluated whether emergent conditional
relations could be demonstrated when two-component stimuli were displayed in figure–ground
relationships—abstract figures displayed on backgrounds of different colors. Five normally capable
adults participated. During training, each two-component stimulus was presented successively.
Responses emitted in the presence of some stimulus pairs (A1B1, A2B2, A3B3, B1C1, B2C2 and
B3C3) were reinforced, whereas responses emitted in the presence of other pairs (A1B2, A1B3,
A2B1, A2B3, A3B1, A3B2, B1C2, B1C3, B2C1, B2C3, B3C1 and B3C2) were not. During tests, new
configurations (AC and CA) were presented, thus emulating structurally the matching-to-sample tests
employed in typical equivalence studies. All participants showed emergent relations consistent with
stimulus equivalence during testing. In Experiment 2, we systematically replicated the procedures
with stimulus compounds consisting of four figures (A1, A2, C1 and C2) and two locations (left – B1
and right – B2). All 6 normally capable adults exhibited emergent stimulus–stimulus relations.
Together, these experiments show that the go/no-go procedure is a potentially useful alternative for
studying emergent conditional relations when matching-to-sample is procedurally cumbersome or
impossible to use.

_______________________________________________________________________________

In the vast majority of stimulus equivalence
research studies, matching-to-sample procedures
are used for teaching stimulus–stimulus relations
and testing for emergent relations (e.g., Sidman,
1994). Other procedures, however, have also
been used in stimulus equivalence research, such
as the contiguous pairing and recombination
method of Leader, Barnes and Smeets (1996)
and the go/no-go method recently reported by
Debert, Matos, and McIlvane (2007).

In the latter study, two abstract black-and-
white figures were displayed side-by-side on the

screen of a computer that controlled all
experimental operations. For example, when
A1B1 compound was displayed, A1 was a circle
on left side and B1 was a figure similar to an
inverted letter ‘‘L’’ on the right side. During
go/no-go training, each two-component stimu-
lus was presented successively for 4 s. Responses
emitted in the presence of certain stimulus
pairs (A1B1, A2B2, A3B3, B1C1, B2C2 and
B3C3) were followed intermittently by reinforc-
ers, whereas responses emitted in the presence
of other compounds (A1B2, A2B1, A2B3, A3B1,
A3B2, B1C2, B1C3, B2C1, B2C3, B3C1 and
B3C2) were not. After accurate performances
were established, probe tests in extinction
displayed new compounds composed of differ-
ent arrangements of the component stimuli—
BA, CB, AC, and CA—following the logic of
procedures used in typical equivalence studies.
Five of six participants subsequently responded
in a manner consistent with the ABC classes
typical of such studies.

According to Sidman’s (1994) definition,
matching-to-sample procedures are not essen-
tial to generate equivalence classes. Indeed, he
wrote (p. 381) that ‘‘A potential equivalence

233

234

relation can be thought of as a kind of bag that
contains all the ordered pairs of events that
constitute the relation … To document the
relation, all we have to do is reach into the bag
… and pull out its member pairs.’’. Following
Sidman’s logic, given the appropriate context,
any procedure that entails ordered pairs of
related events might potentially establish
equivalence relations. Nearly all studies in
the equivalence literature, however, have used
the same matching-to-sample context. The
generality of equivalence class formation fol-
lowing other types of ordered-pair relations
has not been studied systematically, and the
possibilities suggested by Sidman’s analogy
have been evaluated only rarely.

The robust findings of the study by Debert
et al. (2007) inspired further efforts to assess
the limits of
the go/no-go procedures in
establishing equivalence classes. We assessed
two procedural targets: (1) classical figure–
ground relations similar to those that con-
cerned Lashley (1938) and (2) stimulus-
position relations.

Both experiments were conducted with
normally capable adults. These two targets
were selected in part to demonstrate another
feature of go/no-go procedures’ applicability
with stimulus relations that cannot be studied
with straightforward matching-to-sample meth-
ods: that
is, that one cannot separate the
constituent elements of
figure–ground or
stimulus-position compound relation into
sample and comparison stimuli. Moreover,
these two procedure targets seem to map well
onto contingencies encountered outside the
laboratory that require individuals to respond
if and only if certain conditions are fulfilled
and otherwise do nothing (e.g., soldiers are
required to salute only when an officer enters
the room). Laboratory go/no-go procedures
may be useful as a simple way to model such
procedures for controlled study.

EXPERIMENT 1: FIGURE–

GROUND RELATIONS

METHOD

Participants

The participants were 2 males and 3 females
aged 18–29 years. None had prior familiarity
with the experimental analysis of behavior.
Participants were fully debriefed when the
experiment concluded.

Apparatus

All sessions were conducted individually in a
4 m 3 3 m room. An IBM computer with 256-
mm (14-inch) color monitor was used. Each
participant was seated facing the monitor and
could respond directly to stimuli by position-
ing the mouse’s cursor anywhere on it and
depressing the button. A program developed
in Visual Basic controlled all experimental
operations including stimulus presentations
and data recording.

Components of the two-component figure–
ground stimuli could be any one of six abstract
forms (after Markham & Dougher, 1993),
designated as A1, A2, A3, C1, C2, and C3,
and any one of three colors as backgrounds,
designated as B1, B2, and B3. The designations
were not displayed on the computer screen
(see Figure 1). Each abstract form was cen-
tered within a colored background displayed
in the center of the monitor’s screen (see
Figures 2 and 3). The experimental stimuli
were judged physically dissimilar with respect
to form and color; stimulus–stimulus relations
were arbitrarily defined by the contingencies
programmed by the experimenter.

Procedure

Phase I: Training baseline relations. In Phase I,
a differential reinforcement procedure was
used to establish button-pressing to some
figure–ground stimuli (i.e., components to
be related) and not pressing to others (i.e.,
components not-to-be related). At the begin-
ning of this phase, each participant sat facing a
monitor that displayed the following instruc-
tions (translated from the Portuguese):

‘‘This study is not about intelligence testing,
and will not evaluate any aspect of your
intellectual abilities. When it is finished you
will receive a full explanation. I will remain
nearby to solve any technical problems that
may arise with the equipment, but I will not be
able to talk to you. Your goal is to attain as many
points as possible; these points will be shown on the
upper left of the screen. In a defined area in the
center of the screen, there will be symbols. Your task is
to click in this area, with the mouse, when you think
correct symbols are shown, and not to click when
incorrect ones are shown. In the beginning, you
will receive points whenever you click correct
symbols; later on, you will sometimes receive
and sometimes not receive such points. The
task will increase in difficulty as it goes along.

Thus, pay attention even when the task seems
very simple. Please, repeat to me the instruc-
tions you just read.’’

When participants indicated that they un-
derstood the instructions, they received the
following further instruction (also translated):
‘‘When I tell you to start, click where it says
‘OK’. Thank you very much for your partici-
pation!’’

When the participants clicked the OK area,
the experimenter left the room and training
began. A two-component figure–ground stim-
ulus was presented in the center of the screen,
and the counter (initially set at zero) was
displayed in the left upper corner (see
Figure 2). Eighteen different figure–ground
stimuli resulted from combinations of one of

the six abstract forms and one of the three
colored backgrounds (see Figure 3). ‘‘Relat-
ed’’ components were A1B1, A2B2, A3B3,
B1C1, B2C2 and B3C3. ‘‘Not-related compo-
nents’’ were A1B2, A1B3, A2B1, A2B3, A3B1,
A3B2, B1C2, B1C3, B2C1, B2C3, B3C1 and
B3C2.

Each figure–ground stimulus with related
and not-related components was presented for
4 s on each trial, independent of participant
behavior following the procedure used by
Debert et al. (2007). During each trial,
participants could click one or many times
with the mouse. In order to count as a valid
response, however, the mouse cursor had to be
positioned within the figure–ground stimulus
and not in the surrounding area.

The order of presentation of each trial type
varied unsystematically across trials. The order
was restricted such that no trial type could be
presented more than three times successively.
Each figure–ground stimulus with related
components was presented twice in a block
of trials, while each of the not-related figure–
ground stimuli was presented once (see
Table 1). Via this balancing procedure, also
used by Debert et al. (2007), related and not-
related figure–ground stimuli appeared equal-
ly often in a block. Sessions consisted of 12
blocks of 24 trials each (288 trials per session)
and lasted about 30 min.

Valid responses to figure–ground stimuli
with related components were followed by the
sound of tokens falling and by the addition of
10 points on a counter positioned on the
upper-left corner of the computer monitor.
When points were added, the total accumula-
tion flashed for 1.5 s. All trials were separated
by an intertrial interval of 2 s. There were no
stimuli displayed and no programmed conse-
quences for responding during the intertrial
interval.

During the first 36 trials, button presses to
related figure–ground stimuli were immedi-
ately followed by points;
thereafter, points
came on a conjunctive fixed-ratio 1 variable-
time 2.5 s schedule (i.e., at least one response
was made to the related stimuli and 2.5 s, on
average, had elapsed). The conjunctive sched-
ule was used in order to discourage very rapid
responding that might
interfere with the
development of stimulus control by the fig-

ure–ground stimuli. When not-related compo-
nents were displayed, behavior was never
followed by points.

Phase I ended when participants completed
a full session of responding to virtually all of
related figure–ground stimuli and made virtu-
ally no responses to stimuli with not-related
components (see Results).

Phase II: Equivalence tests. This phase was
implemented to test for equivalence relations
with the go/no-go procedure under extinction
conditions involving new compounds with A
and C components. We followed the general
logic of defining equivalence in a manner
consistent with the analysis of Stromer, McIl-
vane, and Serna (1993) and the ‘‘combined’’
tests
for equivalence relations and their
defining properties (i.e., reflexivity, symmetry,
and transitivity) as outlined by Sidman and
Tailby (1982). Equivalence relations would be
shown if participants (1) responded to pairs of
forms that had appeared with the same colors
on figure–ground training trials (i.e., A1C1,
A2C2, A3C3, C1A1, C2A2 and C3A3) and (2)
did not respond to form pairs
that had
appeared with different color on such trials.

At the beginning of Phase II, the instruc-
tions were: ‘‘This is a new phase and your task
will be modified. Work according to what you
have learned. No sounds or points will be
presented. When you are ready to start, click
the ‘OK’ button’’. When the participants
clicked the OK area, the experimenter left
the room and testing began.

Phase II was conducted for one session only.
Table 1 shows all trial types presented in this
phase. Form stimuli were presented in side-by-
side pairs within a neutral background on the
screen (see Figure 3). Eighteen different
stimulus pairs resulted from the combinations
of all six forms (see Table 1). The order of
presentation of stimulus pairs varied unsys-
tematically across trials, again with the restric-
tion that no trial type could appear more than
three times in succession. Each stimulus pair
with related components was presented twice
in a block of trials, while each of the not-
related components was presented once, again
equating related and not-related component
pairs within a block.

All test trials started with 8-s presentations of
a two-component
stimulus. Following the
procedure suggested by Debert et al. (2007),
the duration of stimulus presentation was

increased in testing from 4 s to 8 s in order to
capture responding that was merely delayed
due to the appearance of new trial types in
testing. Again, participants could click once or
many times with the mouse, and valid respons-
es had to be within the area of stimulus
presentation and not in the surrounding area.
Six blocks of 24 trials were presented in a
test
session of about 30 min. The point
counter was not displayed on any such trials.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Table 2 shows the percentage of correct
performances during training and testing for
each participant (i.e., the number of trials with
one or more responses
to figure–ground
components defined as related added to the
number of
trials on which there were no
responses to figure–ground components de-
fined as not-related divided by the total
number of trials). Three participants required
three to four sessions to achieve 100% correct
trials during training. Perfect performance was
not required for 2 other participants ( J and
L), because each spontaneously verbalized
correctly that they recalled making one or
two errors in their session. These participants
achieved accuracy levels of 99.3% correct and
in their fourth and second
99.6% correct
sessions respectively. All participants,
then,
immediately showed the emergence of equiv-
alence relations within one testing session.

The positive findings are strongly in line
with the ‘‘separable compound’’ account
proposed by Stromer et al. (1993), who argued
that equivalence relations could arise at the
level of the three-term contingency (see Sid-
man, 2000, for further consideration of the
relevant issues). Like the participants in the
study by Debert et al. (2007), the present
participants exhibited emergent behavior and
equivalence relations with novel combinations
of stimulus components (i.e.,

nents (i.e.,
Indeed,
the go/no-go
procedures was even more successful than in
our first report, due perhaps to the procedure
modification of allowing somewhat more time
(8 s instead of 4 s) to respond on the test trials
with related components.

In concluding discussion of this experiment,
we note that
the go/no-go trial balancing
procedure used here was not the only balanc-
ing procedure possible. We balanced the trials
such that requiring a ‘‘go’’ response occurred
about equally often as those requiring a ‘‘no-
go’’ response. As a mathematical consequence
of presenting every trial type, stimulus pairs
displayed on ‘‘go’’ trials appeared twice as
often as pairs displayed on ‘‘no-go’’
trials
during training. The alternative would have
been presenting twice as many ‘‘no-go’’ trials
to arrange that every trial type appear equally
often, potentially introducing a bias toward
‘‘no-go’’ responding. With our normally capa-
ble participants, this bias potential was small,
in part because the overall number of training
trials was small. Moreover, our participants
responded appropriately from the outset in a
manner consistent with equivalence of certain
ordered pairs and the nonequivalence of
others, before the greater frequency of the
former was detectable. Thus, our balancing
procedure here appears to have been the
appropriate choice. With other populations
that would likely show less rapid acquisition
(e.g., nonhumans), however, the potential for
introducing response bias via the nature of
balancing may be a greater concern.

EXPERIMENT 2: FORM–

the go/no-go procedure to study

potentially emergent behavior using form–
position compound stimuli. The positions
served the same role in this experiment as
the colored grounds in Experiment 1, but
there was no added stimulus component—the
nodal stimulus was merely the position of the
form in the display.

Participants

METHOD

Participants were 2 males and 4 females
aged 20–26 years. None had prior familiarity
with the experimental analysis of behavior and
were debriefed afterwards.

Apparatus and Stimuli

Apparatus was the same as in Experiment 1.
Compound stimuli were composed of four
abstract forms (designated A1, C1, A2 and C2)
presented on the left position (designated B1)
or right position (designated B2) on the
computer monitor (see Figure 4). Each ab-
stract
form was presented in left or right
location centered in an area at the bottom of
the monitor’s screen (see Figure 5).

Procedure

This experiment had the same two-phase
structure as Experiment 1: Phase I – Training
and Phase II – Equivalence Tests. The differ-
ence was the number of compounds and trials.
In Phase I, eight different compound
stimuli resulted from the combinations of
one of the four abstract forms and one of
the two locations (see Figure 5). Compounds
with related components were A1B1, A2B2,
B1C1 and B2C2. Compounds with not-related

components were A1B2, A2B1, B1C2 and
B2C1. Each compound appeared equally often
within a block. Sessions consisted of 12 blocks
of 8 trials (96 trials per
session). Each
compound was presented for 4 s and each
session lasted for about 10 min.

Compounds with related components were
A1C1, A2C2, C1A1 and C2A2. Compounds
with not-related components were A1C2,
A2C1, C1A2, and C2A1. Eight different com-
pound stimuli resulted from the combinations
of the four abstract forms (see Table 3). Eight
equivalence tests were intermixed in unsys-
tematic order within each of 12 test blocks
(i.e., 96 total test
trials). These tests were
conducted under extinction conditions. Each
compound was presented for 8 s and each
session lasted for about 13 min.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Table 4 shows the percentage of correct
performances during training and testing for
each participant
in Experiment 2. Correct
performance was defined in the same manner
as in Experiment 1.

Participants took from two to six sessions to
reach 100% of correct performances during
training. All participants showed the emer-
gence of equivalence relations within one or
two testing sessions. Unlike the results of
Experiment 1, however, 3 participants (A, E,
G) achieved initially low scores (25%) on
Equivalence Test trials presented in the first
test session. Table 5 presents an analysis of
responding in this session, which shows that all
participants responded to C1A2 and A1C2 and

not to any of the other pairs of forms. These
orderly data may have been due in part to
effects of the training and the circumstances of
testing. Test trials presented forms on the left
and right positions for the first time. Partici-
pants A, E, and G responded initially only to
displays in which the left and right positioning
of the stimuli were compatible with previously
reinforced choices. That is, both C1 and A1 on
the right and A2 and C2 on the left were on

equivalence relations. One question may be
why the other 3 participants apparently ig-
nored the conflict. Perhaps the participants as
a group were presented with two equally

possible solutions to the test trial challenges:
(1) ignore the conflict and respond accord-
ing to the form–position history, or (2)
match the behavior to the conflict situation
by responding only when the stimulus display
presented no conflicts with past
training.
Perhaps it is not surprising that there was a
50%-50% split in the initial responding. Why
the 3 participants who initially exhibited the
latter behavior pattern immediately switched
to the former pattern in the second test
session is not immediately obvious. Perhaps
the entire test session of extinction for the
latter pattern was a variable in occasioning
that switch.

In future studies with the go/no-go proce-
dure and form–position compounds,
the
conflict situation in the present test proce-
dures and perhaps the delayed emergence
might be avoided by presenting test stimuli in
a central vertical position or perhaps closely
spaced horizontally in the center of
the
display. In both cases, the procedure would
avoid presenting specific test stimuli in exactly
the same positions as they appeared during

training, perhaps reducing or eliminating the
conflict created by stimulus-position com-
pounding.
Results

from this experiment and from
another
recent
study (Perez, Campos, &
Debert, in press) address the trial-balancing
issue that was raised in Experiment 1. These
data demonstrate that emergent
stimulus
equivalence relations can be established even
when ‘‘go’’ and ‘‘no-go’’ trials are presented
equally often. Together with the immediate
emergence of stimulus equivalence relations
shown in Experiment 1,
the data from
Experiment 2 support
the suggestion that
unbalanced procedures are not the source of
emergent equivalence relations in go/no-go
procedures. As noted earlier, however, this
assertion may depend upon our use of

Indeed, other populations will be needed to
address the role of preexperimental history,
for example,
the ability to label positions
independently of the stimuli that appear in
them (an important generalized skill
in
human development and functioning).

GENERAL DISCUSSION

sample procedure. On their face, such proce-
dures seem to have the advantage of simplicity
in the stimulus displays—one reason that they
were deemed attractive in early research in
comparative cognition (Mallot, Mallot, Svi-
nicki, Kladder, & Ponicki, 1971; Zentall &
Hogan, 1975). Whether these procedures will
prove ultimately satisfactory is a cause for some
concern in their
future applications with
nonhuman and very young and/or nonverbal
humans given some possible complicating
factors (e.g.,
to avoid re-
sponding largely or entirely on no-go trials).
That acknowledged, go/no-go procedures
have not received the same very extensive
study and methodological development as
matching-to-sample procedures. Perhaps a
program of research focusing on these proce-
dures specifically might overcome these possi-
ble complicating factors, permitting their
other possible advantages to come to the
forefront.

The present results further support

the
suggestion by Debert et al. (2007) that one
might profitably reexamine analyses of sepa-
rate discriminative stimulus
for
sample and comparison stimuli in matching-
samples may act as
to-sample procedures:
‘‘selectors’’ of
the discriminative stimulus
functions of comparisons (Cumming & Berry-
man, 1965) in a conditional discrimination.
Previous investigators have argued on the
basis of parsimony that one need not posit
that conditional discrimination tasks such as
matching-to-sample involve separately de-
fined conditional and discriminative stimuli
with special and different
functions (cf.
Stromer et al., 1993; Thomas & Schmidt,
1989). This issue seems highly relevant in
the present
considering the findings of
for
experiments. How would one assign,
example, different
figure–
ground stimuli or form–position compounds
in our two experiments? If separately de-
fined sample and comparison functions are
not
logically necessary in our procedures,
why should they be postulated in standard
matching-to-sample procedures of the type
studied by Sidman and Tailby (1982) and
many others?
from both
experiments described here and from re-
search
discriminations
question whether going beyond the three-
term contingency relations is necessary to
the analysis of equivalence relations (Sid-
man, 2000). As Sidman has
suggested,
however, certain preparations and behavior-
al histories may in fact require analysis in
terms of 4-, 5-, and perhaps n-term contin-
gencies (Sidman, 1986). Studies of the type
reported here may help in conceptualizing
such higher-level
when specification of
contingencies are and are not
logically
necessary.

Clearly, the go/no-go procedure succeeds as
an alternative to matching-to-sample for study
of emergent stimulus–stimulus relations when
training involves stimuli of the type employed
in the present experiments. An issue for future
research is whether procedures of the type
reported here will produce similar results
when used with nonhumans or humans with
developmental
limitations that tend not to
show emergent relations with matching-to-

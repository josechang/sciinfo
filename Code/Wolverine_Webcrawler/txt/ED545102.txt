Executive Summary 
The 2008/09 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:08/09), conducted for the 

U.S. Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), collected 
information primarily about students’ education and employment in the first year following receipt 
of their bachelor’s degree.  

This report describes the methodology and findings of the B&B:08/09 data collection, 

which included a student interview, a transcript data collection, and an administrative data records 
match.  

Sample Design 

The target population1 for the B&B:08/09 study was students who completed degree 

requirements for a bachelor’s degree between July 1, 2007 and June 30, 2008, and who were awarded 
their bachelor’s degree by June 30, 2009, from a postsecondary institution in the United States or 
Puerto Rico. All sampled students were initially identified as potential bachelor’s degree recipients in 
the 2008 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:08).  

At the conclusion of the B&B:08/09 data collection, the B&B:08 cohort included 17,160 
eligible sample members. Of this sample, 15,050 were considered interview respondents, 16,070 
were considered transcript respondents, and 14,010 were considered combined interview and 
transcript respondents  

Student Interview 

The B&B:08/09 student interview was designed as a single web-based instrument to be used 

for web, telephone, and field respondents. Several methodological features were embedded in the 
instrument to minimize mode effects, such as extensive help text on every form, warnings to alert 
sample members when a response fell outside a predetermined range of likely responses, and 
conversion text to encourage responses to critical items when sample members did not provide a 
response. 

This follow-up interview for the B&B:08 cohort captured respondent information from the 
time period of July 2008 through June 2009 and included seven sections: Eligibility, Undergraduate 
Education, Postbaccalaureate Education/Training, Postbaccalaureate Employment, Kindergarten–
12th Grade (K–12) Teaching, Student Background, and Locating. The interview was administered in 
one of three modes: web, telephone, or field. An abbreviated Spanish interview was also provided.  

The data collection design for B&B:08/09 involved several stages. The initial process of 

locating sample members involved batch-locating activities to update sample members’ address and 
telephone information from several sources. In addition, sample members and their parents were 
sent an initial mailing to collect updated contact information.  

Once the initial round of locating was completed, sample members were sent information 

regarding study participation, and the data collection period began. Data collection was conducted in 
three phases. Sample members who completed interviews during the early response phase (first 
phase) and the nonresponse conversion phase (last phase) were offered an incentive of $30. Sample 
                                                 
1 The target population consists of all students or institutions in the survey population, and is the population to which inferences are 
made.

Executive Summary 

members who completed interviews during the production (middle phase) were not offered an 
incentive. Base-year nonrespondents were offered $50 to complete the interview in the early 
response and nonresponse conversion phases.  

Of the 17,170 sample members included in the B&B:08/09 student interview data collection, 

16,050 (93 percent) were successfully located, and 15,090 either partially or fully completed an 
interview. The response rate was 88 percent among the eligible sample and was 94 percent among 
those sample members who were successfully located. The majority of completed interviews 
(12,240) were obtained in web mode, wherein respondents accessed and completed the interview 
online.  

The B&B:08/09 interview took approximately 28 minutes to complete. On average, web 

respondents completed the interview in 26.6 minutes, telephone respondents completed the 
interview in 33.5 minutes, and field respondents completed the interview in 31.1 minutes. 

An evaluation of the quality of the data provided by the B&B:08/09 student interview 

showed that methodological features, such as help text and conversion text built into the instrument 
and training and supervision of interviewing staff, aided in the successful administration of the 
interview.  

Data collection quality control procedures for the student interview included frequent 

monitoring of telephone interviewers, a help desk that tracked and resolved difficulties encountered 
by sample members attempting to complete the web interview, and quality circle meetings and a 
debriefing for interviewers and tracers. Feedback from these procedures provided useful 
information for consideration when planning future administrations of B&B. 

Transcripts 

Postsecondary transcripts were collected as part of B&B:08/09. Transcripts were requested 
from the institution where B&B sample members completed their bachelor’s degree requirements 
during the 2007–08 academic year (their NPSAS institution), and if this institution had any 
transcripts for any transfer schools previously attended, the transfer transcripts were requested, as 
well. To ease burden on participating institutions, the B&B:08/09 transcript collection was 
combined with the transcript collection for the 2004/09 Beginning Postsecondary Student 
(BPS:04/09) Longitudinal Study. Together, these transcript collections are referred to as the 2009 
Postsecondary Education Transcript Study (PETS:09).   

Multiple transcript submission methods were available to institutions, including several 

secure electronic methods, fax, and FedEx. Information and instructions were available on a study 
website and institution contacting staff members were also available to assist institution staff with 
transcript submissions and questions about the study. Transcripts were requested from 1,100 
postsecondary institutions attended by sample members that were reported by sample members in 
the B&B:08/09 interviews. Of these institutions, 1,020 (93 percent) provided transcripts for the 
cohort. 

Transcript data were collected via a keying and coding process that made use of a specially 

designed keying and coding system (KCS) and a staff of trained keyer/coders. The KCS was divided 
into sections based upon the categories of data found on transcripts, including case information, 
schools and terms, academics, tests, degrees and majors, and courses. A PETS coder was developed 
for the coding of courses by combining the 2010 NCES Classification of Instructional Programs and 
the 2003 College Course Map.

B&B:08/09 Full-scale Methodology Report 

Executive Summary 

Keying and coding of the NPSAS institution transcript was performed for 16,070 sample 

members. When a sample member’s transcript showed courses from another institution these 
courses were entered into the student’s transcript data file only when these credits were accepted by 
the bachelor’s degree-awarding institution. A series of quality control procedures were put in place 
for keying and coding, including key-rekey and expert coder procedures to assess interrater reliability 
and upcoding procedures for uncodeable data and data entered as “other, specify.” Kappa statistics 
were calculated to assess interrater reliability for multiple transcript data elements and all indicated 
substantial agreement between coders. 

File Preparation 

The data files for B&B:08/09 contain student-level data collected from student interviews 

and transcripts, government databases, and administrative databases. These files are available as a set 
of restricted research files fully documented by an electronic codebook and through the NCES 
online application PowerStats, which also contains variable documentation. The editing and 
documentation processes for each file are described in this report.  

Analysis Weights 

Student interview respondents for B&B:08/09 were sample members with a B&B:08/09 

completed, partial, or abbreviated interview. Student transcript respondents were sample members 
who had a transcript provided by the NPSAS:08 institutions. Combined student interview and 
transcript respondents were both interview and transcript respondents. Weights were constructed 
for use in the analysis of these three types of respondents. The three analysis weights were derived 
from the NPSAS:08 weight, and they were adjusted for subsampling, nonresponse, and calibration 
to Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System Completions totals and to sums of the 
NPSAS:08 weights for the B&B cohort. 

Variance Estimation 

The B&B:08/09 sample was obtained using a complex sample design that included 

stratification and clustering, and special techniques were needed for variance estimates. Variables 
were constructed and provided on the data file for bootstrap variance estimation and for Taylor 
series variance estimation.

Foreword 

This report describes and evaluates the methods and procedures used in B&B:08/09. 

B&B:08/09 is the first follow-up interview for the cohort of bachelor’s degree recipients identified 
in NPSAS:08. Transcripts were also collected from the institution where B&B sample members 
completed their bachelor’s degree requirements. Together, the student interview and transcript data 
collections represent a significant and rich data source on this cohort of bachelor’s degree recipients.   

We hope that the information provided in this report will be useful to interested readers.

Chapter 1.  
Overview 

This report documents the methodological procedures and evaluations of the 2008/09 
Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:08/09). RTI, with the assistance of MPR, 
conducted B&B:08/09 for the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) of the U.S. 
Department of Education (Contract No. ED-05-CO-0033). 

Chapter 1 describes the background, legislative authorization, and schedule and products of 

B&B:08/09. Chapter 2 presents the sampling details of the B&B:08 cohort and provides the 
definition of a B&B:08 cohort study respondent. Chapter 3 describes the development of the 
student interview and details of the data collection and results, and provides an evaluation of the 
student interview data quality. Chapter 4 describes the transcript data collection including systems 
for collecting, recording, and evaluating transcript data. Chapter 5 summarizes the file preparation 
process for the B&B:08/09 student interview and transcript data collections. Finally, chapter 6 
provides information pertaining to the weighting and variance estimation procedures for 
B&B:08/09. Materials used during the full-scale student interview and transcript data collection are 
appended to the report and cited in the text where appropriate.  

Throughout this document, reported numbers of sample institutions and students have been 
rounded to ensure the confidentiality of individual student data. As a result, row and column entries 
in tables may not sum to their respective totals, and reported percentages may differ somewhat from 
those that would result from these rounded numbers. 

1.1  Background and Objectives of B&B 

B&B is one of several NCES-sponsored studies developed to address the need for nationally 

representative data on key postsecondary education issues. These studies explore topics related to 
postsecondary access, choices, enrollment, persistence, progress, curriculum, attainment, 
continuation into graduate and professional school, and the benefits of postsecondary education to 
individuals and to society. B&B is a longitudinal spin-off of the National Postsecondary Student Aid 
Study (NPSAS), which is authorized by the following legislation: 

• 

• 
• 

• 

the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended by the Higher Education Opportunity 
Act of 2008, 20 U.S.C. § 1015(a) (2008); 
the General Education Provisions Act, as amended, 20 U.S.C. §§ 9541 to 9548 (2007); 
the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended by the Higher Education Amendments 
of 1986, 20 U.S.C. § 1070 et seq. (2007); and  
the National Education Statistics Act of 1994, as amended, 20 U.S.C. §§ 9541 to 9547 
and 9573 (2007). 

Once students completing their baccalaureate degrees in the NPSAS academic year are 

identified, the B&B series follows them to monitor their progress. Figure 1 shows the data collection 
timeline for the base-year and subsequent B&B follow-up studies.

Although the focus and principal content of the B&B student interviews in each of these 
three cohorts have remained relatively consistent, expert panels and other reviews of the interview 
have helped to shape and alter questions as needed for relevancy. For the B&B:08 cohort, the first 
follow-up interview (B&B:08/09) examined students’ workforce participation; income and debt 
repayment; and entry into and persistence through graduate school programs; as well as several 
issues specifically related to teaching, including teacher preparation, entry into and persistence in the 
profession, and teacher career paths. B&B also gathers extensive information on bachelor’s degree 
recipients’ undergraduate experiences, demographic backgrounds, expectations regarding graduate 
study and work, and participation in community service. See appendix C for a complete list of the 
data elements in the B&B:08/09 student interview and appendix D for a facsimile of the instrument. 

1.2  Schedule and Products of B&B:08/09 

Table 1 summarizes the schedule for B&B:08/09. Electronically documented, restricted-
access research files (with associated electronic codebooks [ECBs]) and NCES online application

Chapter 2.  
Sampling 

Identification of the B&B:08/09 sample required a multi-stage process that began with 

selection of the NPSAS:08 sample of institutions and was followed by selection of students within 
institutions. The final stage confirmed the B&B:08 cohort eligibility of sample members identified 
via NPSAS:08 as baccalaureate recipients during the 2007–08 academic year.  

2.1  Respondent Universe 

To be eligible for inclusion in the B&B:08 cohort, students must have been part of the 

student universe at an institution included in the NPSAS:08 institution universe. The definitions of 
the NPSAS:08 institution and student universes are presented below. 

2.1.1  Institution Universe for NPSAS:08  

The institutions eligible for NPSAS:08 were required meet all criteria for distributing federal 

Title IV aid during the 2007–08 year, including; 

•  offering an educational program designed for persons who have completed a high school 

education;  

•  offering at least one academic, occupational, or vocational program of study lasting at 

least 3 months or 300 clock hours;  

•  offering courses that were open to persons other than the employees or members of the 

company or group (e.g., union) that administers the institution; and 

•  being located in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, or Puerto Rico. 
Institutions providing only vocational, recreational, or remedial courses or only in-house 
courses for their own employees were excluded. U.S. service academies were excluded because of 
their unique funding/tuition base.  

These institution eligibility conditions are consistent with previous NPSAS studies, with two 
exceptions. First, the criterion of being eligible to distribute Title IV aid was implemented beginning 
with NPSAS:2000,1 and second, the previous NPSAS studies excluded institutions that offered only 
correspondence courses. NPSAS:08 included such institutions if they were eligible to distribute 
Title IV student aid.  

2.1.2  Student Universe for NPSAS:08 

Students eligible for NPSAS:08 were those who were enrolled in an eligible NPSAS 

institution, and who satisfied both of the following eligibility requirements: 

• 

they were enrolled in any of the following: (a) an academic program, (b) at least one 
course for credit that could be applied toward fulfilling the requirements for an academic 
degree, or (c) an occupational or vocational program that required at least 3 months or 
300 clock hours of instruction to receive a degree, certificate, or other formal award; and 

                                                 
1 An indicator of Title IV eligibility has been added to the analysis files from earlier NPSAS studies to facilitate comparable analyses.

• 

they were not concurrently or solely enrolled in high school, or in a GED or other high 
school completion program. 

2.2  Base-Year Study (NPSAS:08) 

The sampling design for the base-year study, NPSAS:08, was a two-stage design in which 
eligible institutions were selected in the first stage and eligible students, within eligible responding 
sample institutions, were selected in the second stage. The NPSAS:08 sampling process is described 
in the following subsection. For detailed information on the NPSAS:08 sample allocation and 
statistical design formulas, see appendix A. 

2.2.1  Institution Sample for NPSAS:08 

NPSAS:08 constructed its institution sampling frame from the IPEDS:2004–05 Institutional 
Characteristics, Fall Enrollment, and Completions files. The institutions on the sampling frame were 
partitioned into 46 institution strata based on institution level and control, highest level of offering, 
and proportion of bachelor’s degrees awarded in education.2 NPSAS:08 also included state-
representative undergraduate student samples for four degree-granting institution sectors (public 4-
year; public 2-year; private nonprofit 4-year; and private for-profit 4-year) in six states: California, 
Georgia, Illinois, Minnesota, New York, and Texas.3 

Institutions were selected using Chromy’s sequential probability minimum replacement 

(pmr) sampling algorithm (Chromy 1979), which is similar to systematic sampling. To avoid multiple 
selections of sample institutions, those with expected frequencies of selection greater than unity 
(1.00) were selected with certainty (certainty schools). Initially, a sample of about 1,630 institutions 
was selected in fall 2006 so that these institutions could be notified of their selection early and to 
allow a separate field test sample to be selected from the remaining institutions on the sampling 
frame. In summer 2007, the sample was refreshed using the IPEDS:2005–06 Institutional 
Characteristics, Fall Enrollment, and Completions files to include any newly eligible institutions 
within the sampling frame to ensure that the sample was representative of the current population. 
This process added about 10 institutions to the sample. In fall 2007, the decision was made to 
include state-representative undergraduate student samples for four degree-granting institution 
sectors (public 4-year; public 2-year; private nonprofit 4-year; and private for-profit 4-year) in the six 
states listed above. To accomplish this, a supplemental sample was drawn and added to the existing 
sample. The final NPSAS:08 sample included 1,960 institutions. 

The next step of the institution sampling process involved determining the eligibility of the 
sample institutions. Of the total institution sample (n = 1,960), about 1,940 (99 percent) were found 
to be eligible to participate in NPSAS:08. Of those, approximately 1,730 institutions (a weighted 
response rate of 90 percent among the eligible sample4) provided student enrollment lists for use in 
the second stage of sampling (i.e., selecting the student sample). Table 2 shows the number of 
institutions that were sampled, the number of eligible institutions, and the count and unweighted 
and weighted percentages of institutions providing enrollment lists, by institution characteristics. 

                                                 
2 The proportion of bachelor’s degrees awarded in education is used to ensure sufficient numbers of sample students receiving a 
bachelor’s degree in education. Such students are an important analysis domain for B&B. 
3 These six states were selected based on (1) the size of undergraduate enrollment in the four sectors; (2) prior inclusion in the 
NPSAS:04 twelve-state sample with high levels of cooperation and participation in that survey; and (3) unique or recently changed 
tuition and state grant policies that provided opportunities for comparative research and analysis. 
4 The weight described here is a base weight.

2.2.2  Student Sample for NPSAS:08 

Sample institutions provided lists of their eligible students enrolled during the 2007–08 

academic year, and these lists served as the frame for selecting the student sample. Student 
enrollment lists were sampled on a flow basis, using equal probability stratified systematic sampling. 
Business majors were undersampled to ensure that the sample did not consist primarily of business 
majors, while science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors; Science and 
Mathematics Access to Retain Talent (SMART) grant recipients; and Academic Competitiveness 
Grant (ACG) recipients were oversampled to allow for sufficient numbers for analysis. There were 
20 student strata, as follows: 

1.  in-state potential baccalaureate recipients who were business majors; 
2.  out-of state potential baccalaureate recipients who were business majors;

14. out-of-state other undergraduate students who were ACG grant recipients; 
15. in-state other undergraduate students who were not SMART or ACG grant recipients; 
16. out-of-state other undergraduate students who were not SMART or ACG grant 

recipients; 

17. masters students; 
18. doctoral students; 
19. other graduate students; and 
20. first-professional students. 
For each student sampling stratum, the enrollment list was sampled at a rate designed to 
provide approximately equal student-level probabilities. To more accurately estimate the overall 
sample yield, student sampling rates were revised after sufficient lists had been received. The final 
sample included 137,800 students. Approximately 96 percent of the final sample (n = 132,800) was 
determined to be eligible for NPSAS. On the completion of data collection, 96 percent of the 
eligible sample (n = 127,700) was determined to have sufficient key data to meet the definition of a 
study respondent. A study respondent was defined as any sample member who was determined to 
be eligible for the study and, minimally, had valid data from any data source, including an institution 
record abstraction (computer-assisted data entry [CADE]), the NPSAS:08 student interview, and 
record matching against several administrative databases (e.g., the U.S. Department of Education’s 
Central Processing System [CPS]) for the following:

In previous NPSAS studies that derived a B&B cohort, lists of potential baccalaureate 
recipients were collected with the student list of all enrolled undergraduate and graduate/first-
professional students. However, these baccalaureate lists often could not be provided until late in 
the spring or in the summer when baccalaureate recipients could be positively identified, which 
negatively affected the data collection schedule. To encourage an earlier receipt of enrollment lists, 
4-year institutions were asked to include an indicator (B&B flag) of students who had received or 
would potentially receive a baccalaureate degree during the NPSAS year (between July 1, 2007, and 
June 30, 2008).5 Institutions were instructed to make this identification before spring graduation. 
Four-year institutions were also asked to include an indicator of class level for undergraduates (first

year, second year, third year, fourth year, or fifth year). From NPSAS:2000, it was estimated that 
about 55 percent of the fourth- and fifth-year students would be baccalaureate recipients during the 
NPSAS year and that about 7 percent of third-year students would also be baccalaureate recipients. 
This class-level indicator was used when the B&B flag was not provided for any students. These two 
indicators were used instead of requesting a separate baccalaureate recipient list.  

Because most enrollment lists were received before June 30, and many were received before 

April, some sample students identified by the institution as baccalaureate candidates were 
determined during the NPSAS interview not to be baccalaureate recipients (false positives). Likewise, 
some sample students not identified by the institution as baccalaureate candidates were determined 
during the NPSAS interview to have received baccalaureate degrees (false negatives) during the 
specified timeframe.  

2.3  First Follow-up Study (B&B:08/09) 

The primary task of the B&B:08/09 sample definition process was to confirm or reject a 

potential respondent’s baccalaureate status.  

Individuals eligible for the B&B:08 cohort were those who completed requirements for a 

bachelor’s degree from a NPSAS:08-eligible institution between July 1, 2007, and June 30, 2008, and 
were awarded their baccalaureate degree by the institution from which they were sampled no later 
than June 30, 2009. Eligibility for the B&B:08 cohort was based primarily on information obtained 
from the student’s transcript. Transcripts were collected prior to the B&B:08/09 interview under the 
2009 Postsecondary Education Transcript Study (PETS:09). Lacking a transcript, eligibility was 
based on responses provided during the NPSAS:08 student interview. Without either the transcript 
or the interview, eligibility was based on the student’s institution record obtained through NPSAS:08 
CADE or the enrollment list provided by the NPSAS:08 institution at the time of student sampling. 
Also, the transcript and NPSAS:08 interview data were reviewed to determine eligibility for students 
who confirmed in the NPSAS:08 interview that they received their bachelor’s degree but whose 
transcript did not indicate degree receipt. If such students were deemed to be eligible or eligibility 
could not definitively be determined, then they were included in the sample. The National Student 
Clearinghouse (NSC) data on degree completion were used to identify eligible students but could 
not identify ineligible students with certainty. These data were used for stratification. Table 4 shows 
the distribution of the 25,050 NPSAS:08 sample members who were potentially eligible for 
membership in the B&B:08 cohort according to their NPSAS:08 interview, CADE, and/or 
enrollment list status.

Of the 18,000 students who completed the NPSAS:08 interview and were confirmed to be 
eligible for the B&B:08 cohort, about 84 percent (15,050) had a transcript that confirmed eligibility 
at the time of sampling, 6 percent (1,060) were ineligible based on transcripts, and 11 percent (1,890) 
did not have a transcript. Table 5 shows the transcript status of the B&B:08 cohort with

Additionally, transcripts were requested for the 7,050 NPSAS:08 interview nonrespondents 

who were either confirmed in CADE to be degree candidates or listed by the NPSAS:08 sample 
institution as bachelor’s degree candidates. Approximately 5,150 of these NPSAS:08 nonrespondents 
were determined to be eligible or eligibility could not be determined for B&B:08/09 based on 
transcript data. In order to have full population coverage of the B&B:08/09 sample, a subsample of 
500 of these 5,150 NPSAS:08 interview nonrespondents was selected. The sample was selected to 
maximize eligibility. The 5,150 NPSAS:08 interview nonrespondents were stratified based on study 
respondent, transcript, NSC, and CADE statuses. Within each stratum, the nonrespondents were 
first sorted by institution sector to ensure the representativeness of the sample and were also sorted 
by the NPSAS:08 sampling weight within sector. Then, the sample was drawn within each stratum 
with probabilities proportional to the NPSAS:08 sampling weight. The sampling rates used in each 
stratum were different in order to maximize response and eligibility rates while also representing the 
various types of sample members. The B&B:08/09 sample is not intended to be representative at 
the state level. 

Based on the B&B:08/09 field test results, the highest sampling rates were among students 

who were NPSAS:08 study respondents, were potentially eligible based on NSC or CADE, and were 
confirmed eligible by the transcript. The next highest sampling rates were among students who were 
NPSAS:08 study respondents, were potentially eligible based on the enrollment list but not based on 
NSC or CADE, and were confirmed eligible by the transcript. The third highest sampling rates were 
among students who were NPSAS:08 study respondents, were potentially eligible based on NSC, 
CADE, or the enrollment list, but had no transcript, and among students who were not NPSAS:08 
study respondents, were potentially eligible based on NSC, CADE, or the enrollment list, and were 
confirmed eligible by the transcript. The lowest sampling rates were among students who were not 
NPSAS:08 study respondents, were potentially eligible based on NSC, CADE, or the enrollment list, 
but had no transcript.6 Table 6 shows the distribution of the potential baccalaureate recipients 
without a NPSAS:08 interview and the subsample. These distributions are based on whether or not 

                                                 
6 The number of students who were not NPSAS:08 study respondents, were potentially eligible based on NSC, CADE, or the 
enrollment list, but had no transcript, was small, so these students were combined into one stratum for sampling purposes.

2.4  B&B:08 Cohort 

There were 25,050 NPSAS:08 sample members who were potentially eligible for 

membership in the B&B:08 cohort according to their NPSAS:08 interview, CADE, and/or 
enrollment list status. Between the NPSAS:08 data collection and the start of the B&B:08/09 data 
collection, sample members whose transcripts, NPSAS:08 student interview, or administrative data 
showed they were ineligible, as well as deceased sample members, were removed from the B&B:08 
cohort. At the beginning of the B&B:08/09 data collection 18,500 individuals were included in the 
B&B:08/09 sample. Prior to the start of B&B:08/09 data collection, 1,320 individuals were found to 
be ineligible leaving 17,170 eligible individuals in the sample.  

At the end of the B&B:08/09 data collection 17,160 eligible sample members remained in 
the B&B:08 cohort (deceased cases were removed). Of the 17,160 eligible sample members 15,050 
were considered B&B:08/09 student interview respondents, 16,070 were considered transcript 
respondents, and 14,010 were considered combined interview and transcript respondents.7 

A B&B:08/09 student interview respondent was defined as any sample member who was 

determined to be eligible for the study, was not deceased at the time of the B&B:08/09 data 
collection, and had a completed, partial, or abbreviated interview. A student transcript respondent 
was defined as any sample member who was determined to be eligible for the study, was not 
deceased at the time of the B&B:08/09 data collection, and had a transcript provided by the 
NPSAS:08 institution. A combined student interview and transcript respondent was both an 
interview and a transcript respondent. 

                                                 
7 The 15,050 interview respondents exclude 40 cases on which data collection analyses are based in Chapter 3. These 40 cases were 
sampled as NPSAS interview respondents but they did not have enough data to be NPSAS study respondents.

Chapter 3.  
Student Interview Design, Data Collection, 
Outcomes, and Evaluation 
The B&B:08/09 student interview was designed for web, telephone, and field administration 
and included an abbreviated Spanish interview. Sample members were primarily located using batch 
address and phone sources and were asked to complete the student interview between July 2009 and 
Mach 2010. Analyses and evaluation of data collection from a student interview field test as well as 
from this full-scale study provided information for consideration when planning future 
administrations of B&B.  

3.1  Student Interview Design and Systems 

The B&B:08/09 student interview consisted of seven sections, grouped by topic. 

B&B:08/09 abbreviated interviews were also offered in English and Spanish; these abbreviated 
interviews consisted of selected questions from all sections. This section provides the details of the 
student interview design and systems. 

3.1.1  Student Interview Design 

The content of the interview was based on previous B&B student interviews created for the 
B&B:93 and B&B:2000 cohorts, and on a B&B:08/09 student interview field test, building on data 
elements developed with input from the study’s Technical Review Panel (TRP) and from NCES. 
For a list of TRP members, see appendix B; for a list of the final set of student interview data 
elements, see appendix C. 

The interview consisted of seven sections, grouped by topic. Respondents were guided 
through each section of the interview according to skip logic that took into account previously 
provided information from the NPSAS:08 and information recorded as the respondent progressed 
through the B&B:08/09 interview. Following are descriptions of the seven interview sections.  

1.  Eligibility determined eligibility for the survey based on date of completion of bachelor’s 

degree requirements at the NPSAS institution. In order to continue with the survey, 
respondents had to indicate that they completed bachelor’s degree requirements between 
July 1, 2007, and June 30, 2008, and that they had been awarded the bachelor’s degree 
from the NPSAS institution by June 30, 2009.  

2.  Undergraduate Education gathered enrollment information on all postsecondary institutions 

attended prior to receiving the bachelor’s degree from the NPSAS institution. This 
section also captured NPSAS institution major or field of study, enrollment intensity, 
and academic experiences such as course withdrawals or academic honors. The section 
concluded with questions about undergraduate financial aid received by respondents and 
satisfaction with undergraduate education and choice of major. 

3.  Postbaccalaureate Education/Training collected information about the respondent’s 

postbaccalaureate schools including any undergraduate or graduate degrees or certificates 
received after the NPSAS bachelor’s degree, related majors or fields of study, enrollment

Chapter 3. Student Interview Design, Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

intensity, reasons for attendance, and financial aid received. The section concluded with 
questions about nondegree coursework and future education plans.  

4.  Postbaccalaureate Employment captured the respondent’s current employment status and job 

characteristics such as job title and duties, earnings, average hours worked per week, 
benefits, employer industry, and employer’s ZIP code. This section also captured 
information about the relationship of the job to the bachelor’s degree field, number of 
jobs held since graduation, and periods of unemployment.  

5.  Kindergarten–12th Grade (K–12) Teaching collected K–12 teaching preparation and interest 
and teacher and content area certifications. This section also collected teaching positions 
since graduation with the bachelor’s degree, names of K–12 schools where the 
respondent taught, grade levels and subjects taught, experiences in the first teaching job 
such as participation in a teacher internship or mentor program, satisfaction with 
teaching and plans for staying in teaching, and awareness of the Teacher Education 
Assistance for College and. Higher Education (TEACH) Grant and teacher loan 
forgiveness programs. 

6.  Student Background obtained information about student demographic characteristics, 
including citizenship, military status, foreign language proficiency, marital status and 
household composition, annual income and monthly expenses, voting behavior, 
volunteerism, and disability status.  

7.  Locating captured contact information for the second follow-up study. 
The interview sections and principal topics in each section are summarized in figure 2. For 

the complete B&B:08/09 full-scale instrument facsimile, see appendix D.

B&B:08/09 Full-scale Methodology Report 

Chapter 3. Student Interview Design, Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

A single instrument was developed to be administered in one of three modes: web, 

telephone, or field. For telephone and field interviews, the interviewer accessed the web instrument 
through RTI’s case management system.  

To minimize mode effects, specific methodological features were incorporated into the 

instrument to provide web respondents with the assistance normally provided by a trained 
interviewer: 

•  help text on every form to define key terms and clarify question intent; 
•  pop-up messages to correct responses that were out of range or in an incorrect format; 
•  conversion text to encourage responses to critical items when these items were left 

unanswered; and 

•  pop-up messages prompting sample members to provide a response when they left three 

consecutive questions blank. 

Additionally, instructions indicating how each question was to be administered (e.g., whether the 
response options were to be read aloud, when to probe) were included for telephone and field 
interviewers on each screen to minimize differences between interviews administered by an 
interviewer and web interviews.  

Coding systems. Assisted coding systems were used in the interview to standardize the 

collection and coding of the respondent’s postsecondary schools attended, major or field of study, 
occupation, and any elementary or secondary schools where the respondent may have taught. The 
name or title of each of these items was entered as a text string in each coder and a keyword search 
conducted on an underlying database returned a list of possible matches. An assisted coding system 
was not used to code industries, but available industry classifications allowed respondents and 
interviewers to select an industry classification from among a list of standardized options. Following 
are descriptions of the individual coding systems and sources: 

•  The postsecondary school coder was developed from the set of institutions contained in the 

Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), developed by NCES 
(http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/). For any schools not listed in the database, respondents 
were asked to provide the control (e.g., public or private) and level (e.g., 4-year or 2-year) 
of the school.  

•  The major coder was constructed using the 2010 Classification of Instructional Programs 
(CIP) taxonomy, also developed by NCES (http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cip2010). For any 
majors or fields of study not listed in the database, respondents were asked to provide a 
general major area and a specific discipline.  

•  The occupation coder was built from the Occupational Information Network Online 

(O*NET OnLine) database (http://online.onetcenter.org). For any occupations not 
listed in the database, respondents were asked to provide a general area, a specific area, 
and finally a detailed classification area for the occupation. 

•  The industry coder was based on the North American Industry Classification System 

(http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html). A text string was collected from the 
respondent, and then the respondent was asked to choose the category that best 
described his or her employer’s industry. Industry choices were laid out in general 
categories across the screen. When the respondent selected a category, examples of 

B&B:08/09 Full-scale Methodology Report 

17 

Chapter 3. Student Interview Design, Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

businesses within that industry were displayed, allowing the respondent to determine the 
appropriateness of the industry chosen.   

•  The elementary and secondary school coder (“El/Sec coder”) was used to code any elementary 
or secondary schools where respondents had taught. The NCES data sources used for 
schools in the El/Sec coder were the Private School Universe Survey for private schools 
(http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pss/) and the Common Core of Data for public schools 
(http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/). On the two forms prior to the El/Sec coder, the respondent 
indicated whether the school was public or private, and then provided the city and state 
of the school. For schools not identified within the El/Sec coder, the entered text string 
was retained, and respondents were asked to supply the school type (public, private, etc.); 
the names of the school’s district, county, or both; and the lowest and highest grade 
levels that were taught at the school.  

Spanish interview. A Spanish abbreviated interview was developed for primarily Spanish-
speaking sample members. The Spanish abbreviated interview comprised the same questions as the 
English abbreviated interview, which included selected questions from all sections. The Spanish 
interview was made available to respondents in web mode. This mode of administration required the 
translation into Spanish of not only question wording and response options, but also of all the 
specific methodological features incorporated into the instrument to provide web respondents with 
the assistance normally provided by a trained bilingual interviewer (i.e., help text, pop-up messages 
to correct responses that were out of range or in an incorrect format, conversion text, and general 
error messages). The two coders in the Spanish abbreviated instrument, the major coder and the 
occupation coder, were not translated; however, instructions were provided in Spanish to both 
respondents and bilingual interviewers explaining that they should choose a major or occupation 
code in English, if possible, or instead enter a text string in Spanish and not attempt the coding of 
the major or occupation. 

3.1.2  Data Collection Systems 

This section describes the data collection systems used for the B&B:08/09 data collection, 
including the Hatteras Survey Engine and Survey Editor (RTI’s proprietary web-based interviewing 
software), the Instrument Development and Documentation System (IDADS), and the Integrated 
Management System (IMS). 

Hatteras Survey Engine and Survey Editor. The B&B:08/09 survey instrument was 

created with Hatteras, a web-based system in which project staff developed, reviewed, tested, 
modified, and communicated changes to specifications and code for the instrument. All information 
relating to the instrument was stored in an SQL Server database and was made accessible through 
web browser interfaces. Hatteras provided specification, programming, and testing interfaces for the 
B&B instrument as follows. 

•  Specifications. Hatteras provided the tools and user interface for developing interview 

specifications. Specification content included wording at the form, question, item, and 
response option levels; help text content; item-level data documentation; and form-level 
question administration documentation. Specific capabilities of the Hatteras system 
allowed instrument designers to import any relevant specifications used in prior studies, 
create skip logic and item documentation, and search a library of survey items. 
Instrument designers were also able to take advantage of a comprehensive comment 

18 

B&B:08/09 Full-scale Methodology Report 

Chapter 3. Student Interview Design, Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

tracking system to communicate and test necessary instrument changes with 
programmers.  
A web interface provided access for project staff at MPR and at NCES to test and 
comment on the instrument throughout development.  

•  Programming code. For simple instrument questions and items, Hatteras automatically 
translated specifications into web page scripts when the web page was accessed. For 
questions involving complex routing, multiple question wording or response option 
conditions, or nonstandard page layout or behavior, programmers entered custom 
programming code—HTML, JavaScript, and C#.NET script—into the Hatteras custom 
code interface. This code was stored in the SQL Server database, together with the 
instrument specifications for compilation by the survey execution engine. 
Instrument testing and execution. The Hatteras system’s survey execution engine allowed 
immediate testing of specification and code content on a test link. The execution engine 
also automatically handled such web instrument functions as backing up and moving 
forward, recording instrument timing data, displaying critical-item wording, validating 
user input, displaying conditional instructions based on interview mode (web, telephone, 
or field) and linking to context-specific help text. 

• 

•  Survey sites and data transfer—web/telephone. For web and telephone data collection, the 

Hatteras survey execution system was installed on NCES surveys web server farm and 
SQL Server database. Web respondents accessed the survey directly by web browser 
after logging in with a user ID and password. RTI’s telephone interviewers accessed the 
same NCES web survey site by means of a web browser process launched from an RTI 
Case Management System (CATI-CMS).8 All connections to the NCES web interview 
were secured with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. Automated processes 
transferred data between RTI’s local database and the NCES database via a secure, 
encrypted connection. 

•  Survey sites and data transfer—field. For field interviews, the Hatteras survey execution 
system was installed on local web and database servers on laptop computers. Field 
interviewers accessed the laptop-based survey by logging in through three independent 
levels of security, including a whole-disk encryption outer level. Interview control and 
response data were transferred between RTI and field laptops via secure, encrypted 
automated connections. 

IDADS. The web-based IDADS documentation module contained the finalized version of 

all instrument items, their screen wording, and variable and value labels. Also included were the 
more technical descriptions of items such as variable types (alpha or numeric), to whom the item 
was administered, and frequency distributions for response categories based on completed interview 
data. The documentation module was used to generate the instrument facsimiles and the deliverable 
ECB input files. 

IMS. All aspects of the study were controlled using an IMS, a comprehensive set of desktop 
tools designed to give project staff and NCES access to a centralized, easily accessible repository for 

                                                 
8 The Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing Case Management System (CATI-CMS) is the system that assigns cases to be called 
and provides telephone interviewers with the appropriate screens and scripts to be used during the contacting and locating phase of 
CATI.

Chapter 3. Student Interview Design, Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

project data and documents. The B&B:08/09 IMS consisted of several components: the 
management module, the Receipt Control System (RCS) module, and the instrumentation module. 
•  Management module. The management module of the IMS included tools and information 

to assist project staff and the NCES project officer in managing data collection. All 
management information pertinent to the study was located there, accessible via the 
Web, and protected by SSL encryption and a password-protected login. The IMS 
contained the current project schedule, monthly progress reports, daily data collection 
reports and status reports (generated by the RCS described below), project plans and 
specifications, project deliverables, instrument specifications, a link to the Hatteras 
system, staff contacts, the project bibliography, and a document archive. 

•  RCS. The RCS is an integrated set of systems that was used to control and monitor all 

activities related to data collection, including tracing and locating. Through the RCS, 
project staff were able to perform tracing and data management operations, track case 
statuses, identify problems early, and implement solutions effectively. The RCS’s locator 
data were used for a number of daily tasks related to sample maintenance. Specifically, 
mailout systems produced paper mailings and e-mailings to sample members, the query 
system enabled administrators to review the locator information and status for a 
particular case, and the mail return system enabled project staff to update the locator 
database as mailings or address update sheets were returned or forwarding information 
was received. The RCS also interacted with the computer-assisted telephone interviewing 
(CATI) system, sending locator data between the two systems as necessary. 
Instrumentation module. The instrumentation module managed development of the 
multimode web data collection instrument within Hatteras. Developing the instrument 
with Hatteras ensured that all variables were linked to their item and screen wordings 
and were thoroughly documented.

3.2  Student Interview Data Collection 

The B&B:08/09 interview data collection involved training data collection staff and locating, 
contacting, and interviewing sample members. Each of these procedures is detailed in this section.  

3.2.1  Training of Interview Data Collection Staff 

Members of the data collection staff included quality control supervisors (QCS), help desk 

agents (HDAs), telephone interviewers, field interviewers, and intensive-tracing staff. Prior to 
beginning work on B&B, all data collection staff completed a comprehensive training program. 
Topics covered in training programs included a review of confidentiality requirements, an overview 
of B&B:08/09, frequently asked questions, and administrative procedures for case management as 
well as hands-on practice. All training programs were designed to maximize active participation of 
the trainees. The training schedule and number of data collection staff trained are presented in table 
8. The specific roles and duties of data collection staff are summarized in the following subsections, 
along with a description of the training program (see appendix E for training materials).

QCS provided support and guidance for the telephone interviewers, monitored interviewer 
production, and helped troubleshoot problems. They attended B&B project supervisor training and 
also participated in telephone interviewer project training. Training included an overview of 
B&B:08/09, conversational interviewing techniques expected of interviewing staff, problem 
resolution, case review, an explanation of project-specific reports, and other specific project 
procedures and protocols. The quality control supervisors were also provided with a supervisor 
manual to be used as a reference throughout the course of data collection. 

HDAs. A staff of help desk agents assisted sample members who had questions or 

problems while completing web interviews. Help desk agents were certified telephone interviewers 
specially trained to unlock cases, reissue passwords, record and track calls to the study help line via 
the help desk application, and effectively respond to callers’ questions. During the early response 
period, help desk agents also made prompting calls to NPSAS:08 interview nonrespondents and 
completed telephone interviews with sample members who preferred a telephone to a web 
interview. Help desk training materials included a project telephone interviewer manual with a help 
desk supplement and various project handouts. 

Telephone interviewers. Telephone interviewers were responsible for gaining cooperation 
from and conducting interviews with sample members, averting and converting interview refusals, 
and addressing the concerns of reluctant sample members. Telephone interviewers received 12 
hours of training that included an overview of the study, an in-depth review of the interview 
instrument, hands-on practice administering the telephone interview, review of appropriate 
conversational interviewing techniques, and practice with the CATI-CMS. At the conclusion of 
training, all telephone interviewers were certified by successfully conducting mock telephone 
interviews and by providing satisfactory responses to the study’s frequently asked questions. 
Telephone interviewer training materials included a telephone interview manual and multiple project 
handouts. 

Field interviewers. Field interviewers conducted interviews, either in person or by 

telephone, with sample members residing in 17 selected geographic clusters in the U.S. and Puerto 
Rico. Field interviewers were required to attend a 4 hour training session held via teleconference.9 
Each field interviewer was required to complete a home study exercise prior to the teleconference 
training. Field interviewers, all of whom had recently completed an in-depth classroom training on 
field data collection techniques for their work on BPS:04/09, received additional training on the 
field case management system, coding, management of the case assignment folders, and proper care 
                                                 
9 All field interviewers trained to work on B&B:08/09 had recently completed work on BPS:04/09, a study with similar procedures; 
therefore, the B&B:08/09 training included only content specific to this study.

and use of the B&B laptops. Field interviewers were also required to conduct successful certification 
mock interviews and multiple other certification exercises with their field supervisor over the phone 
before they were permitted to begin work. Field interviewer training materials included a field 
interviewer manual and additional handouts and forms used to document all field procedures and 
expectations of work. 

Tracing staff. Tracing staff (tracers) used intensive measures (described in section 3.2.3) to 

locate sample members designated as lacking good telephone contacting information. Tracers 
attended a comprehensive 16-hour training session that was led by RTI tracing managers within 
RTI’s Call Center Services (CCS) and covered all tracing procedures. Tracers also received 2 hours 
of project-specific training. They received an overview of B&B, a review of the FAQs, background 
information on the B&B sample, and the tracing techniques best suited to locating B&B sample 
members. 

Additional trainings. Selected staff received additional training modules, such as refusal-

conversion training, and Spanish interview training (for certified bilingual staff). Additionally, quality 
circle meetings were routinely conducted as an extension of the training program for continual 
quality improvement. Data collection staff were given the opportunity to ask questions in meetings 
and as needs were identified, additional training topics were highlighted and addressed in subsequent 
meetings. After each meeting, quality circle notes were posted on the call center’s project website 
and on the project IMS. 

3.2.2  Study Website 

B&B:08/09 sample members were provided a link to the B&B website prior to the start of 
data collection. The website provided general information about the B&B set of studies, including 
details about the study sponsor and contractors, how the data are used, answers to frequently asked 
questions, confidentiality assurances, and selected findings from earlier studies. The website also 
provided contact information for the study help desk and project staff at RTI, as well as links to the 
main NCES and RTI websites. Sample members were able to log in to the secure portion of the 
website to provide updated contact information and complete the student interview once it became 
available. 

Designed according to NCES web policies, the B&B:08/09 website used a three-tier security 
approach to protect all data collected. The first tier of security included secure log-ins, with a unique 
study ID and strong password provided to sample members prior to the start of data collection. The 
second tier of security protected any data entered on the website with SSL technology, allowing only 
encrypted data to be transmitted over the Internet. The third tier of security stored any collected 
data in a secured SQL Server database located on a server machine that was physically separate from 
the Web server. Figure 3 shows the home page for the B&B:08/09 website.

3.2.3  Locating and Contacting Sample Members 

Several locating methods were used to find and collect up-to-date contact information for 
the B&B:08/09 sample (figure 4). Batch searches of national databases and prenotification address 
update mailings were conducted prior to the start of data collection. After the start of data collection 
and for those sample members not yet found, follow-up locating methods were employed, including 
CATI locating, intensive tracing, and field tracing.

Study (B&B:08/09).  

Batch tracing. Before mailing activities began, batch database searches were conducted to 

update sample member contact information. These searches used the CPS and the U.S. Postal 
Service (USPS) National Change of Address databases. The information obtained from these 
sources was compared with the information previously available from the NPSAS:08 locator 
database to identify any new contact information. Then, just prior to the start of outbound 
telephone interviewing, all sample member addresses and telephone numbers were sent to 
Telematch, a computerized residential telephone number service with the not-yet-published 
numbers of new movers, to obtain any telephone number updates.   

Mailings. In May 2009, about 7 weeks before the start of B&B:08/09 data collection, a 

mailing was sent to the parents of base-year respondent sample members younger than 26 years old, 
to gain their assistance with providing up-to-date contact information for these sample members. 
This mailing included a study brochure, a letter with detailed information about B&B:08/09 signed 
by the associate commissioner of NCES, an address update sheet, and a business reply envelope. 
(Parents of base-year nonrespondent sample members younger than 26 years old received their 
version of the letter in October 2009.) 

The final step in the predata collection locating and contacting effort occurred in June 2009, 

approximately 4 weeks before the start of data collection, with a similar address update mailing 
going to sample members (using any updated contact information provided by parents, if 
applicable). The mailing contained a letter notifying sample members of the upcoming B&B:08/09 
data collection, the study brochure, an address update sheet, and a business reply envelope. Sample 
members were asked to update their address information on the address update sheet and return it 
in the postage-paid envelope. They also had the option of entering the information using the online 
form available on the B&B study website. The address update sheet and online form included a 
space prompting sample members to indicate a preference for being notified by text message of the 
start of data collection.   

24 

B&B:08/09 Full-scale Methodology Report 

Chapter 3. Student Interview Design, Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

B&B data collection started on July 13, 2009, with the mailing of a data collection 

announcement to base-year respondents by USPS first-class mail in a 9 x 12 inch B&B envelope. 
Base-year nonrespondents received their mailing in November, also by USPS first-class mail in a 
9 x 12 inch B&B envelope. The mailing to all sample members included a study brochure and a 
letter that announced the start of data collection. The letter, signed by both the B&B project director 
and the NCES project officer, included a $5 bill and informed sample members of the additional 
cash incentive for completing the interview by the early incentive deadline specified in the letter, 
provided the study website and sample member’s user ID and password for accessing the web 
interview, and provided the study’s toll-free help desk number and e-mail address. The same day, an 
e-mail containing information comparable to that in the data collection announcement letter was 
sent to sample members.  

As soon as a parent address was available, a letter was also mailed to parents of all base-year 
respondent sample members younger than 26 years old explaining the importance of the study and 
asking parents to encourage sample members to participate. The letter was sent to parents of all 
base-year nonrespondent sample members younger than 26 years old in October 2009.  

Additional mailings included a postcard reminder sent about 10 days after the data collection 

announcement and two additional e-mail reminders to encourage early interview response. Once 
outbound telephone interview efforts began and throughout data collection, periodic mailings and e-
mails went to interview nonrespondents throughout the course of data collection (for student 
interview data collection notification materials, see appendix F). 

CATI locating and preintensive tracing. Telephone interviewers made prompting calls to 
base-year nonrespondents during the early response period of data collection. These calls, described 
in more detail in section 3.4.1, helped identify cases that required further tracing in addition to 
encouraging early response. Once outbound telephone interviewing began, telephone interviewers 
conducted limited tracing and locating activities as needed. The telephone number believed to be the 
best known number for contacting the sample member was attempted first. If the sample member 
could not be reached at that number after several attempts, any other numbers associated with the 
sample member, including parent and other contacts, were called. If the sample member could not 
be located, the case was designated for FastData and Accurint batch services which provided an 
automated search for matching phone numbers to sample members using combinations of address, 
name, and Social Security number (SSN). Cases for which neither FastData nor Accurint Batch 
generated new telephone numbers were sent for intensive interactive tracing by RTI’s Tracing 
Operations (TOPS). 

Overall, for B&B:08/09 data collection, the batch matching successfully confirmed contact 
information or provided new contact information for 20,070 records. The most records, 8,300, were 
matched through Telematch. While the fewest records, 570, were matched through FastData, this 
data source combined with Accurint minimized the number of cases requiring more costly intensive 
tracing. Table 9 shows the match rates for each tracing source.

Intensive tracing. The most difficult locating cases were traced at TOPS using a two-tiered 

strategy and a number of sources. TOPS-1, the first tier, identified sample members with SSNs 
available to trace through consumer databases (FastData’s SSN search and Experian) that contain 
current address and telephone listings of consumers with credit histories. If a search generated a new 
telephone number for the sample member, tracers attempted to confirm the information by 
speaking with the sample member or with someone else who could verify the information. If the 
telephone number was confirmed, the case was sent back to CATI for telephone interviewing. This 
first level of effort minimized the time that cases were in tracing and unavailable for CATI efforts. 
Cases still not located and that were not in a field cluster underwent a more intensive level of tracing 
in TOPS-2. TOPS-2 included calls to other possible sources of information, including, for example, 
directory assistance, alumni offices, and contacts with neighbors or landlords. Whenever any of 
these sources provided information that indicated a sample member was not available for the study 
(e.g., deceased, incarcerated, or out of the country), no further contact efforts were made.   

Overall, about 7 percent of eligible sample members required intensive tracing (table 10). 

Thirty-three percent of the NPSAS:08 interview nonrespondents required intensive tracing, 
compared with 6 percent of NPSAS:08 interview respondents (z = 12.15, p < .001). Nine percent of 
sample members at private, for-profit, 2-year-or-more NPSAS institutions required intensive tracing, 
compared with 6 percent of sample members whose NPSAS institutions were private, nonprofit 4-
year doctorate-granting schools (z = 3.02, p < .001).

Field tracing. Any cases not located after TOPS-1 intensive tracing and thought to be in 
one of the 17 selected geographical field clusters were designated for field tracing instead of TOPS-
2. Information provided to field interviewers included all address and telephone information 
available for an assigned case, the results of TOPS-1 intensive tracing efforts, and the details of all 
call attempts made by telephone interviewers. In addition to these tracing resources, field 
interviewers had access to contacts within the community, such as post office mail carriers or local 
public records that could provide additional information. Many field interviewers also had the added 
advantage of calling from telephones with local area codes familiar to sample members, increasing 
the likelihood that sample members would respond to the telephone calls. 

3.2.4  Interviewing 

Data collection for the B&B:08/09 interview consisted of three phases (figure 5): 
1.  Early response phase. This phase began with the start of data collection in July 2009 for 

base-year respondents and lasted approximately 4 weeks. Data collection began in waves, 
based on the early incentive expiration date assigned to each case. The early response 
phase for base-year nonrespondents began in November 2009. Base-year respondents 
who completed the interview during their early response phase received an incentive of 
$30; base-year nonrespondents received a $50 incentive.10 

                                                 
10 Base-year nonrespondents received telephone prompting calls during the early response phase to remind them of their inclusion in 
the study and to encourage their participation. 

B&B:08/09 Full-scale Methodology Report 

27 

Chapter 3. Student Interview Design, Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

2.  Production phase. During this phase, which only applied to base-year respondents, 
interviewers called to encourage sample members to complete the interview by 
telephone or on the Web. No incentive was offered during this phase. 

3.  Nonresponse conversion phase. Cases in this phase belonged to one of the following groups: 
interview refusal by the sample member or a sample member contact, hard-to-reach,11 not 
locatable after intensive tracing, insist-pay,12 base-year nonrespondents who did not 
complete during the early response phase, and field cases that did not fit into one of the 
preceding groups. Base-year respondents who completed the interview during the 
nonresponse conversion phase were offered a $30 incentive and base-year 
nonrespondents were offered a $50 incentive. Data collection ended in March 2010.   

Figure 5.  Data collection phases: 2009 

 
SOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 2008/09 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal 
Study (B&B:08/09). 

Sample members could complete the interview on the Web or by telephone throughout the 
data collection period. The interview screens in the telephone and field interviews were identical to 
those in the web interviews, except that interviewer instructions on how to administer each question 
were visible at the top of each screen for telephone and field interviews. Following are details of the 
administration of the interview through the various modes. 

Web interviews. Sample members were informed of the web interview in the data 

collection announcement mailing. During the early response period (the first 4 weeks of data 
collection), only web interviews were completed unless sample members initiated a telephone 
interview by calling the help desk or sending an e-mail asking to be called. Reminder mailings and e-
mails were sent throughout the production and nonresponse conversion phases of data collection to 
encourage sample members to complete the interview online. The website was accessible 24 hours a 
day, 7 days a week, throughout the data collection period, providing sample members with the 
option to complete the interview online at any time. 

Help desk operations. The help desk for B&B:08/09 opened on July 14, 2009, in 

anticipation of the first respondent calls after the data collection announcement mailing. Help desk 
staff were available to assist sample members who had questions or problems accessing and 
completing the web interview. A toll-free help line was established to accept incoming help desk 
calls. If technical difficulties prevented sample members from completing the web interview, help 
desk agents—also trained to conduct telephone interviews—encouraged sample members to 
complete a telephone interview.  
                                                 
11 Hard-to-reach cases were those that were called at least 15 times (8 times for base-year nonrespondents) and yielded minimal or no 
contact with the sample member. 
12 Insist-pay cases were those in which sample members completed the interview during the production phase but insisted on receiving 
the incentive amount offered during the early response phase. 

28 

B&B:08/09 Full-scale Methodology Report 

Chapter 3. Student Interview Design, Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

A help desk application was created to document incoming calls from sample members and 

other contacts. Specifically, the help desk application included the following: 

information needed to verify the sample member’s identity; 
login information needed by the sample member to access the web interview;  

• 
• 
•  a means to update sample member contact information, as needed; 
• 

functionality to unlock cases and send an e-mail containing the website and study login 
information to the sample member; 
systematic documentation of each call; 

• 
•  a means for tracking calls that could not be resolved immediately; and 
•  a record of the CATI-CMS events, which also included prior help desk events. 
The help desk application provided project staff with the resolution status of all help desk 

events and reports on the type and frequency of problems experienced by sample members. 

Telephone interviews. Telephone follow-up locating and interviewing began on August 13, 

2009, after the 4-week early response period ended for the group of cases with the first early 
response incentive expiration date. Telephone interviewing procedures included attempts to locate, 
gain cooperation from, and interview sample members who had not yet completed the interview. 
Interviewers encouraged sample members to complete the interview by telephone; however, sample 
members could still complete the interview on the Web, if that was their preference. Sample 
members who did express a preference to complete a web interview were called back 5 days later for 
follow-up if the interview had not yet been completed. 

The CATI-CMS included an automated call scheduler that assigned cases to interviewers by 
case priority, time of day, day of week, existence of previously scheduled appointments, and type of 
case. Case assignment was designed to maximize the likelihood of contacting and interviewing 
sample members and cases were assigned to various queues accordingly. For example, the CMS 
included queues for new cases that had not been called, Spanish-language cases, initial refusals,13 and 
various appointment queues. In addition, available telephone numbers for each case were 
automatically prioritized for the interviewers. As new roster lines14 were added—as a result of CATI 
tracing, other tracing efforts, and information from other sources such as respondent e-mails or help 
desk call-ins—available telephone numbers were re-prioritized based on the new information. 

Some cases required special treatment. For cases with sample members or contacts who 
spoke only Spanish, bilingual interviewers were available to administer a Spanish interview (see 
section 3.1.1 for details regarding the Spanish interview). To gain cooperation from those sample 
members who initially refused to participate (including contacts who acted as gatekeepers to the 
sample member), interviewers were trained in refusal-conversion techniques. As the end of data 
collection approached, all telephone interviewers were trained to administer the abbreviated English-
language interview to reluctant sample members.  

Field interviews. Field data collection activities began approximately 5 months after the 

start of outbound telephone interviewing, during the nonresponse conversion phase of data 
                                                 
13 An initial refusal was an interviewer’s first indication that the sample member did not wish to participate in an interview. 
Interviewers typically followed-up on initial refusals in attempts to convert sample members into interview respondents. 
14A roster line represented a unique telephone number to call in CATI.

collection. Using the last known address for each case, RTI’s Geographic Information System 
program conducted an analysis of the B&B:08/09 sample to identify the 17 geographic areas with 
the highest density of sample members residing within a 100-mile radius of the cluster center. On 
the basis of this analysis, 16 field interviewers were hired. An Integrated Field Management System 
provided reports that helped project staff manage the progress of the field interviewing effort. Once 
assigned to the field, cases were excluded from further outbound efforts from the call center, but 
could still be completed on the Web or by telephone if sample members called the help desk to 
complete the interview. See section 3.4.1 Student Interview Response Rates for results of field, 
telephone, and web interviews. 

3.2.5  Other Procedures to Maximize Locating and Interview Response 

Throughout data collection the B&B project team continued to work with TOPS and other 
available resources to evaluate additional tracing efforts that could benefit B&B data collection. In 
addition to the locating sources and methods already described, B&B:08/09 used several other 
procedures to maximize locating and interview response. 

Other locating methods. Other locating methods used to find sample members included: 
•  Experian credit header search. In January 2010, an Experian credit header search was 

conducted to obtain phone numbers and addresses associated with sample members 
according to their credit histories. This search, conducted for sample members who had 
not yet been located or were located but not reached for several weeks, provided a 
relatively low-cost alternative to other intensive tracing methods. 

•  Additional in-house tracing of field cases. Field cases that resulted in dead-end information 

were sent back through TOPS for additional leads. Cases for which additional leads were 
identified through this special tracing effort were returned to the field, and those for 
which no new information was found were closed. The results of this special tracing 
effort are described in more detail in section 3.4.1. 

Other contacting methods. Text messaging, social networking (Facebook and MySpace), 

and an informational video were additional methods used to contact sample members and 
encourage interview completion. 

•  Text messages. Some sample members were contacted by Short Message Service 

technology, or text messaging. A text message reminder to complete the B&B:08/09 
interview was sent during the early response data collection period to those sample 
members who had requested on their address update sheet that a text message be sent. 
The text message mentioned the B&B interview and included the help desk number, the 
early incentive expiration date, and the incentive amount available. The text messages 
were sent via e-mail addresses that were based on the sample member’s phone number 
and their service provider. 

•  Social networking. Two popular social networking sites, Facebook and MySpace, were used 
to generate new leads for and make contact with sample members who were difficult to 
locate. B&B:08 cohort information on record—such as postsecondary institutions 
attended, city/state networks and e-mail addresses—was used to search for sample 
members on Facebook or MySpace. Once the targeted individual was believed to be 
found, a message describing B&B and the incentive being offered, as well as reminding 
the individual of any past participation in the study, was sent through internal messaging 

30 

B&B:08/09 Full-scale Methodology Report 

Chapter 3. Student Interview Design, Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

on the social networking site. Although the message included the study website and help 
desk telephone number, no personally identifying information (such as login 
information) was included; this information could only be provided to a sample member 
who visited the study website or contacted the help desk and verified his or her identity. 
Efforts to contact sample members by Facebook were ceased because of restrictions on 
the number of messages sent to individuals. When few B&B messages were opened by 
sample members contacted through MySpace, the use of social networking sites was 
abandoned in favor of the other, more promising locating and contacting methods. 

•  YouTube video. Near the end of B&B:08/09 data collection, RTI developed a brief video 
designed to encourage participation of sample members who had not yet completed the 
interview. This video was posted to YouTube, a website popular with the age group that 
makes up most of the B&B:08/09 sample. The video provided information about the 
study, including confidentiality procedures. The video also mentioned the incentive 
amount being offered.15 Sample members who had not yet completed the interview were 
sent an e-mail on January 25, 2010, with a link to the video. Mention of the video, along 
with a shortened web page address that redirected visitors to the video’s web page, was 
also included in a mailing sent on February 11, 2010. Before posting the video, project 
staff adjusted the account and video settings including turning off features to prevent 
sample members from identifying one another. 

3.3  Data Collection Quality Control 

A number of quality control procedures were implemented throughout the course of the 

B&B:08/09 student interview data collection. These procedures included frequent interview 
monitoring of telephone interviewers, a help desk that tracked and resolved difficulties encountered 
by sample members attempting to complete the web interview, quality circle feedback meetings, and 
help desk agent and interviewer debriefings at the conclusion of the study. 

3.3.1  Interview Monitoring 

Regular monitoring of telephone interviews during B&B:08/09 data collection was 

conducted to meet the following important data quality objectives: 

• 
Identification of problem items in the interview; 
•  Reduction in the number of interviewer errors; 
• 

Improvement in interviewer performance through reinforcement of effective strategies; 
and 

•  Assessment of the quality of the data collected. 
QCS and project staff monitored live and recorded interviews throughout data collection, 
using remote monitoring telephones and computer equipment. To guarantee an accurate reflection 
of data collection activities, QCS monitored day, evening, and weekend shift interviewers. In 
addition, each week QCS and interview project staff monitored one live interview session and one 
recorded interview session. The live session allowed for monitoring of calls and interviews in 
progress, including remotely viewing interviewers’ computer screens as they progressed through the 
                                                 
15 Because two different incentive amounts were being offered based on base-year response status, two versions of the video were 
created so that the correct incentive offer was mentioned to each sample member.

interview and listening to interviews in real time, while the session with recorded interviews allowed 
only listening to the interview but guaranteed an opportunity to hear complete interviews. QCS and 
interview project staff recorded observations on standardized monitoring forms that covered such 
topics as interviewer professionalism, question administration, and knowledge of the instrument. 
After each monitoring session, interviewers received feedback based on observations from the 
session. Issues and trends identified during monitoring were frequently incorporated into quality 
circle meetings to improve the quality of telephone interviews. 

3.3.2  Help Desk 

A help desk, described in Section 3.2.4, was available to sample members. To gain a better 

understanding of the problems encountered by sample members, HDAs used a web-based 
application to record each help desk incident that occurred during data collection. For each incident, 
an HDA confirmed contact information for the sample member, noted the source (e.g., incoming 
telephone call, voice mail, or email; request from the study website), recorded the type of problem, 
provided a description of the problem and resolution, and indicated the incident status (pending or 
resolved). If the problem was not resolved immediately, the HDA scheduled a follow-up 
appointment.  

Table 11 provides a summary of help desk incidents encountered during B&B:08/09 data 
collection. HDAs handled a total of 460 help desk incidents. The most common type of incident 
was from sample members requesting their study ID, password, or both (68 percent). Pop-up 
blocker issues were the second most common category (13 percent).

3.3.3  Quality Circle Meetings 

Quality circle meetings were essential as part of a feedback loop for ensuring that project 

staff, CCS, and telephone interviewers were communicating on a regular basis about the goals of the 
study and addressing challenges encountered along the way. These meetings provided a forum for 
discussing elements of the instrument design and interview cooperation tactics, motivating the group 
toward the goals of the study, and acquiring feedback on data collection issues. Weekly quality circle 

32 

B&B:08/09 Full-scale Methodology Report 

Chapter 3. Student Interview Design, Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

meetings for telephone staff were held at the call center, while quality circle meetings for the field 
staff were held via conference call. Issues discussed at the quality circle meetings were added to 
weekly quality circle notes, which all interviewers were required to access electronically. The quality 
circle notes included counts of interview completions to date, separate sections for general data 
collection issues and issues specific to the survey instrument, and project staff responses to 
questions from interviewers. 

Throughout the study, a variety of issues were addressed at the quality circle meetings that 
reinforced specific content from training and contributed to prompt problem solving. Some of the 
issues covered in quality circle meetings included the following: 

•  clarification of questions and item responses and reinforcement of positive interviewing 

techniques; 

•  methods of gaining cooperation from sample members and gatekeepers (e.g., parents and 

roommates); 

the importance of interviewers providing and reviewing detailed case comments; 

•  problem sheets submitted by interviewers during interviews; 
• 
•  data security protocols; and 
• 
B&B:08/09 used an interactive, activity-based quality circle meeting format. In the new

meeting structure, interviewers participated in training activities intended to make meetings more 
engaging and to improve the quality of data collected from telephone interviews. Debriefing of 
interviewers showed that they generally enjoyed the new quality circle meeting format and often 
attributed improvements in their interview times and knowledge to these training activities. 

3.3.4  Debriefing 

At the conclusion of the B&B:08/09 data collection, project staff held debriefing meetings 

with interviewers and HDAs. In the debriefings, interviewers were asked their opinions on the 
effectiveness of interviewer training; the success of the various techniques for tracing, locating, and 
gaining sample member cooperation; and any difficulties associated with administering the student 
interview. Interviewer feedback on their experience conducting the B&B student interview was 
typically positive, and interviewers provided several useful recommendations for future data 
collections. 

Interviewers suggested that future trainings could include spending more time on techniques 

for converting sample member refusals to participate in the student interview and for gaining 
cooperation from gatekeepers. Regarding student interview administration, interviewers indicated that 
the new quality circle meeting format, which included varied training activities, was beneficial 
because it allowed for increased communication between interviewers and project staff and because 
activities were interesting as well as informative. Interviewers suggested that for future studies, 
quality circle meetings continue to focus on the difficulties associated with administering interviewer 
coders, particularly the occupation and industry coders. Interviewers also noted that quality circle 
meetings were a useful time to work on improving interviewing skills such as keeping sample 
members engaged during interviews.

3.4  Student Interview Data Collection Outcomes 

This section provides the results of the B&B:08/09 student interview data collection. Details 

of the overall student interview response rate of 88 percent are included, and a description of the 
success of various locating methods is also provided. A timing analysis shows that the student 
interview, on average, took about 28 minutes to complete.  

3.4.1  Student Interview Response Rates 

B&B:08/09 interviews were conducted from July 13, 2009 to March 12, 2010. Of the 17,170 

eligible sample members in the B&B:08 cohort, 16,050 (93 percent) were successfully located and 
asked to complete the B&B:08/09 interview, while 15,090 (88 percent) did complete a full interview, 
an English or Spanish abbreviated interview, or a partial interview.16 The overall locating and 
interviewing results for the B&B:08/09 interview data collection effort, including sample members 
who were determined ineligible and those located but later considered exclusions for reasons such as 
being incapacitated or deceased, are presented in figure 6.

Response rates by base-year status and institution type. NPSAS:08 interview 

respondents were located and completed the B&B:08/09 interview at a higher rate than NPSAS:08 
interview nonrespondents.17 NPSAS:08 interview respondents had a locate rate of 94 percent, while 
72 percent of NPSAS:08 nonrespondents were located. Of all NPSAS:08 respondents, 89 percent 
completed the B&B:08/09 interview, while 49 percent of NPSAS:08 nonrespondents completed the 
B&B:08/09 interview.  

Overall locate rates for the B&B:08/09 interview, based on the institution type of the sample 

member’s base-year interview (NPSAS) school,18 ranged from 90 percent (private, for-profit 2-year 
or more schools) to 94 percent (public 4-year doctorate-granting schools, private, nonprofit 4-year 
non-doctorate-granting schools and private, nonprofit 4-year doctorate-granting schools). Overall 
response rates for the B&B:08/09 interview, by NPSAS institution type, ranged from 85 percent 
(private, for-profit 2-year or more schools) to 89 percent (private, nonprofit 4-year non-doctorate-
granting schools). Locating and participation results by NPSAS:08 respondent status and NPSAS 
institution type are presented in table 12.

Response by phase of data collection. Two-thirds (67 percent) of all completed 

B&B:08/09 interviews and over three-fourths (80 percent) of web interviews were completed during 
the early response phase. Approximately 9 percent of all interviews were completed during the 
production phase, and the remaining 24 percent were completed during the nonresponse conversion 
phase. Response, by phase of data collection, is shown in figure 8.

The early response phase of data collection yielded a 59 percent response rate for the eligible 

sample of 17,170. In this phase, base-year respondents received $30 to complete the student 
interview while base-year nonrespondents received $50 to complete the interview. In the next phase 
of data collection, the production phase, no incentive was offered. Of the 7,040 eligible sample 
members remaining in the production phase, 19 percent completed the interview. In the final phase 
of data collection, the nonresponse conversion phase, 64 percent of the remaining 5,700 eligible sample 
members completed the interview. Sample members who completed the interview in this last phase 
of data collection received either $30 if they were base-year respondents, or $50 if they were not.

Locate and response rates by source of address update. Address updates for the 

B&B:08 cohort were received from 6,780 eligible sample members in response to the parent initial 
contact mailing (for sample members younger than age 26), the student advance notification mailing, 
or through the B&B website. If an address update was received, the sample member was located 
almost 100 percent of the time and the sample member then completed the B&B:08/09 interview 98 
percent of the time. Parents and students responded equally to the parent mailing and advance 
notification mailing (each mailing yielded a 26 percent update). Student address updates through the

Of the 80 eligible sample members who received an early text message notifying them that 
data collection had begun, 96 percent completed the interview. These were sample members who 
had requested a text notification reminder of the start of data collection on their address updates.  
Prompting response rates. Base-year nonrespondents were selected to receive prompting 
calls to complete the web interview during the early response phase of data collection. Of the 460 
eligible base-year nonrespondent cases, 380 cases (82 percent) were flagged for prompting. (The 
remaining 80 cases were not prompted because of either missing/invalid telephone numbers or 
because a B&B:08/09 interview was completed prior to the start of prompting.) Prompting calls 
began 8 days after the start of data collection, and 260 cases were successfully prompted. For those 
successfully prompted, there was not a significant difference between the response rate during the 
early response phase of data collection for sample members who were contacted (spoken to directly) 
in a prompting call (10 percent), compared with sample members who were not contacted (not 
spoken to directly; 7 percent). The response rates during the early response phase of data collection 
for base-year nonrespondents who were contacted when prompted versus those who were not 
contacted when prompted are compared in figure 9.

Response rates for field cases. Beginning about 5 months into data collection, cases 

identified as difficult to locate but believed to reside in a selected field cluster were assigned to field 
data collection. Of the 920 eligible cases assigned, 68 percent were located and 60 percent completed 
the interview in one of the three available modes (web, telephone, or field). Of the completed cases 
assigned to the field, 150 (26 percent) were actually completed by web, or by telephone through the 
call center, instead of through field efforts.  

Results by base-year response status and NPSAS institution type are also presented for these 
cases. Nearly 62 percent of base-year respondent cases assigned to the field completed the interview 
compared with 42 percent of base-year nonrespondent cases assigned to the field. 

Response rates among eligible cases assigned to the field also varied by sample members’ 
NPSAS institution type. The largest number of cases assigned to the field for any one institution 
type, 370 cases, was for sample members whose NPSAS institution was a public 4-year doctorate-
granting institution; these cases yielded a response rate of 59 percent. Only 70 cases were assigned to 
the field for sample members from private, for-profit, 2-year-or-more schools; these cases yielded a 
response rate of 62 percent. Table 18 shows locate and response rates among the field cases.

3.4.2  Interview Timing Burden 

Several analyses for the B&B:08/09 interview assessed the timing burden on respondents 
completing the interview. These analyses included computation of the overall average time it took 
respondents to complete the interview and the time it took respondents to complete the interview 
based on mode of administration (web, telephone or field), as well as analysis of whether particular 
respondent characteristics, such as employment or teacher status, were related to interview timing 
burden. 

To calculate the time it took to complete the interview, two time stamps were embedded on 
each form (web screen) of the interview. A start timer recorded the clock time on the respondent’s 
or interviewer’s computer when each form was first displayed. An end timer recorded the clock time 
on the respondent’s or the interviewer’s computer when the Next button on each form was clicked. 
From the two time stamp variables, an on-screen time and a transit time were calculated. The on-
screen time was calculated by subtracting the start time from the end time for each form that the 
respondent saw. The transit time was calculated by subtracting the end time of the preceding form 
from the start time of the next form. Total on-screen time and total transit time were calculated for 
all respondents by summing all of the on-screen times for each screen received and summing all of 
the transit times for each respondent. Total instrument time was then calculated by summing a 
respondent’s total on-screen and total transit times. 

The timing analysis included only cases that completed the full-scale interview in one 

session. Partially completed interviews and those interviews completed in multiple sessions (i.e., 
those cases that logged out from an incomplete interview and later resumed their interviews) were 
excluded from the analysis.  

The average overall interview time was calculated by summing the respondents’ interview 

completion times and dividing the result by the total number of respondents. On average, the 
B&B:08/09 interview took 27.7 minutes to complete. Web interviews took 26.6 minutes to 
complete, field interviews took 31.1 minutes to complete, and telephone interviews took 33.5 
minutes to complete.  

Average section completion times were 1.4 minutes for the Front End (introductory 

section), 1.1 minutes for Eligibility, 7.2 minutes for Undergraduate Education, 2.2 minutes for 
Postbaccalaureate Education/Training, 6.8 minutes for Postbaccalaureate Employment, 3.6 minutes 
for Kindergarten-12th Grade Teaching, and 3.8 minutes for Student Background. On average, all 
sections took the longest in telephone mode. Table 19 shows the average interview time overall, for 
each section, by mode of administration.

Interview time by interview path. The time it took respondents to complete the 

B&B:08/09 interview varied by whether respondents had any postbaccalaureate employment, and by 
whether they had taught since receiving their bachelor’s degree.  

The Postbaccalaureate Employment section focused on the job(s) held in the year after 
completing a bachelor’s degree. This section collected information regarding current job duties, 
benefits and requirements, and periods of unemployment, if applicable. On average, the 
Postbaccalaureate Employment section took 5.8 minutes to complete. Table 20 shows that 
respondents who were employed spent longer in the employment section (6.8 minutes) compared to 
those respondents who were not employed (1.7 minutes).

The K-12 Teaching section collected information about the respondent’s experiences with 
or interest in teaching kindergarten through the 12th grade. Table 21 shows respondents who had 
never been a teacher and were not planning or preparing to become a teacher took an average of 0.4 
minutes to complete the section. Respondents who were current or former teachers, or who were 
either considering or preparing for teaching, took 3.6 minutes. The latter group is divided even

Timing of abbreviated interview. The abbreviated version of the B&B:08/09 interview 
included the Front End, Eligibility section, and questions from the other sections of the interview. 
Table 22 shows that, on average, the B&B:08/09 abbreviated interview took 13.6 minutes. Overall, 
web abbreviated interviews took 11.8 minutes and were significantly shorter than telephone 
abbreviated interviews, at 16.9 minutes (t(313) = -7.38, p < .001 ). Telephone interviews were 
significantly longer than field interviews at 12.5 (t(212) = 5.08, p < .001).

3.4.3  Telephone Interviewer Hours 

During the course of B&B:08/09 data collection, 9,291 telephone interviewer hours were 

logged, for an average of 3.79 hours spent by telephone interview staff per completed or partial 
telephone interview. Because, on average, telephone interviews took 33.5 minutes to administer, 
most of the telephone interviewer hours were spent on case management activities. These activities 
included locating and contacting sample members, prompting sample members to complete 
interviews, reviewing call history, scheduling callbacks, entering detailed comments and suggestions 
to assist with reaching and interviewing sample members, and responding to incoming help desk 
calls. Near the end of data collection, telephone interviewers also spent about two weeks intensively 
reviewing nonrespondent cases to identify the most appropriate next step for each case.  

3.4.4  Number of Calls to Sample Members 

On average, nine calls were made per B&B:08/09 sample member during the interviewing 

period, except for in the early response phase when no outbound calls were made to sample 
members. The average number of calls per sample member varied according to B&B:08/09 
response status, base-year response status, mode of administration, and phase of data collection. 
Cases that completed a B&B:08/09 interview received an average of 6 calls, while nonrespondents 
received an average of 32 calls during the interviewing period. Base-year respondents received 9 
fewer calls, on average, than base-year nonrespondents (9 and 18, respectively) (t(478) = 10.98, 
p < .001). 

There were also call count differences depending on mode of interview administration. 

Overall, respondents who completed interviews over the telephone required more calls than 
respondents who completed interviews over the web, an average of 14 calls, compared with 3 calls 
(t(2,898) = 33.50, p < .001). However, when early response phrase interview completes were 
excluded, web respondents required more calls than telephone respondents, an average of 17 calls, 
compared with 14 calls (t (4,836) = 8.91, p < .001). The average number of telephone calls is shown 
in table 23.

3.5  Evaluation of Student Interview Items 

An evaluation of the B&B:08/09 student interview items included analyses of the data 

collected in the instrument coders and a review of help text access rates, success rates for conversion 
text, and item nonresponse.  

3.5.1  Instrument Coders 

Assisted coding systems were used to standardize the collection of data on, and code, any 

postsecondary schools attended, major or field of study, occupation, and any elementary or 
secondary schools where the respondent may have taught. Text strings were collected from the 
respondent, and then a keyword search of an underlying database was conducted, allowing the 
respondent to select the best option from a list of possible options returned. An assisted coding 
system was not used to code industries, but available industry classifications allowed respondents 
and interviewers to select an industry classification from among a list of standardized options (for a 
detailed description of each coder, see section 3.1.1).  

Recoding. Ten percent of the major, occupation, and industry codes chosen in the student 
interviews were randomly selected to be reviewed by expert coding staff for recoding. 19  Expert coders 
assessed the accuracy of codes chosen in the interview based on the text string provided by the 
respondent. Across modes of administration and across coders, expert coding staff generally agreed 
with the codes chosen for text strings in the interview. Overall, expert coders agreed with major, 
occupation, and industry codes chosen in the student interview 90 percent of the time, recoded 
codes chosen to a new value 7 percent of the time, and were unable to choose a code based on too 
vague a text string about 3 percent of the time.  

Only the industry coder showed significant differences in recode rates between modes of 

administration. Expert coders agreed with industry codes chosen by web respondents 79 percent of 
the time and with those chosen by interviewers 90 percent of the time (z = 4.24, p < .001). Expert 
coders recoded industry codes chosen by web respondents 17 percent of the time, and recoded 
those chosen by telephone and field interviewers 7 percent of the time (z = 4.65, p < .001). Industry 
text strings provided by web respondents and were too vague to code 4 percent of the time, as were 
industry text string provided by interviewers. Table 24 shows the rate of recoded values—same as 
original code, recoded to different value, or text string too vague to code—chosen by the expert 
coders for the major, occupation, and industry codes in the interview.  

                                                 
19 Recoding of institution codes selected in the postsecondary and elementary and secondary school coders was not done because text 
strings provided by respondents would presumably have directly matched school name codes chosen. In the major, occupation, and 
industry coders, text strings provided by respondents and standardized names of codes in the database were often not direct matches.

Upcoding. Project staff chose an appropriate code for any text strings provided by 

respondents or interviewers for which a code was not selected in the IPEDS, major, occupation, 
industry, and elementary/secondary school coders. Text strings from web interviews generally 
required more upcoding than text strings from telephone and field interviews because interviewers 
received special training on coders. Results of the upcoding process are shown in table 25.

3.5.2  Help Text  

Respondents or interviewers were able to click on a help button provided on each 

B&B:08/09 interview screen for both general instrument and question-specific help. The general 
instrument help provided answers to FAQs about web browser settings and response types (i.e., 
how to respond using a check box, dropdown box, or radio button). The question-specific help 
provided definitions of key terms and phrases used in question wording and response options and 
provided any other explanations thought to help clarify and standardize the meaning of questions 
for respondents. 

The number of times that respondents or interviewers clicked the help button on each 

screen relative to the number of respondents who were administered the question determined the 
rate of help text access for that screen. The screen-level rate of help text access was analyzed overall 
and by mode of interview administration to identify screens that may have been problematic for 
users. For forms administered to at least 50 respondents, the overall mean rate of help text hits per 
screen was less than 1 percent. Help text was accessed 2 percent of the time during interviews by 
telephone and field, compared with 1 percent of the time by web respondents (z = 13.30, p < .001).

The interview question asking respondents for their employer’s primary industry (item name 

RDINDCD) had the highest overall rate of help text access, at 4 percent. The help text for this 
question was accessed 16 percent of the time by telephone and field interviewers, compared with 1 
percent of the time by web respondents (z = 30.99, p < .001). It is worth noting here that 
interviewers were encouraged as part of their training to refer to the help text on this item when 
respondents showed hesitation in understanding the term “industry.” 

Table 26 shows the three interview questions administered to at least 50 respondents and for 

which help text was accessed at a rate of at least 2 percent.

3.5.3  Conversion Text 

Fifteen questions in the interview were considered critical; that is, responses to these 

questions were especially important to the study and high rates of missing data on these questions 
would impact the quality of these data. When respondents did not provide an answer to these 
questions and the Next button was clicked on the interview screen, then conversion language (or 
conversion text) appeared above the question to encourage a response. Interviewers were asked to read 
conversion text to respondents and then to reread the interview question. The conversion text 
attempted to relay the importance of that particular question to the study and emphasized the 
confidential nature of responses. Some critical questions also displayed a don’t know response option 
for respondents once the conversion text was triggered.  

Dividing the total number of responses to the critical questions after the conversion text was 

displayed by the total number of cases where the conversion text was triggered provided a 
conversion rate for the questions that was attributed to the conversion text. Overall, conversion text 
was triggered in the student interview approximately 1170 times throughout data collection. Eighty-
five percent, or 1000, of these cases were converted to a response after the conversion text was 
displayed. The web interviews accounted for 980 of the 1170 cases where conversion text was 
triggered and 880 of the 1000 converted cases. The remaining 190 cases where conversion text was 
triggered were in telephone and field interviews, of which 120 were converted. The rate of 
conversion as measured by the triggering of conversion text was 90 percent in web interviews, 
compared with 63 percent in telephone and field interviews (z = 9.75, p < .001). There was not a

way to measure conversion to a response by telephone and field interviewers before conversion text 
was triggered. 

Conversion text was triggered more than 100 times for three interview questions. The 

occupation coder (RDOCC1) triggered conversion text in 340 cases and yielded a conversion rate of 96 
percent. Web cases were converted at a rate of 96 percent, compared with telephone and field cases, 
which were converted at a rate of 67 percent (z = 2.69, p < .01). Monthly rent or mortgage payment 
amount (RFMTGAMT) triggered conversion text in 310 cases, with a conversion rate of 69 percent. 
Web cases were converted at a rate of 81 percent, compared with telephone and field cases, which 
were converted at a rate of 39 percent (z = 7.09, p < .001). Amount owed for undergraduate loans 
(RBUGOWE) triggered conversion text in 120 cases, and produced a conversion rate of 84 percent 
with no significant mode difference. Table 27 displays the rates of conversion for all 15 items in the 
interview with conversion text. Conversion rates were examined overall and by mode.

3.5.4  Item Nonresponse  

Rate of nonresponse was a data quality measure used to identify troublesome interview items 

and better understand the experiences of sample members in completing the interview. Total 
nonresponse rates were calculated for items with missing data (including don’t know responses) that 
were administered to at least 100 respondents. Overall, the item-level nonresponse analysis yielded 
36 items out of 1,358 interview items with more than 5 percent missing data. 20 

Items on coders returned relatively high rates of nonresponse21. The item with the highest 

rate of nonresponse, (RESDST01), was the district name on the elementary/secondary school coder. 
Of the 210 respondents who received this item, approximately 67 percent did not provide a text 
string for their elementary/secondary school’s district. Approximately 13 percent of respondents did 
not enter a text string for their original major in the major coder item (RBORGMAJ), 18 percent of 
respondents did not enter a text string for their job duties in the occupation coder item (RDJBDY), 
and 19 percent did not enter a text string for their employer’s industry in the industry coder item 
                                                 
20 Partial and abbreviated interview completions and missing data for interview nonrespondents were excluded from this analysis. For 
interview items with multiple iterations, this analysis will evaluate the first iteration only.   
21 Results of item nonresponse in this section apply only to the respondents to the B&B:08/09 interview and are not weighed by the 
B&B analysis weight. Chapter 6 provides additional details on the item nonresponse, the potential bias due to item nonresponse, and 
the impact of the item imputation which was used to fill in missing data and to reduce item nonresponse bias.

Chapter 3. Student Interview Design, Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

(RDIND). In addition, there were several income questions among those items with nonresponse 
rates greater than 5 percent. Approximately 42 percent of respondents did not provide an estimate 
of their spouses income on spouse’s income estimate for 2008 (RFINSRA), and 30 percent did not 
provide an amount for their private student loan debt on amount borrowed in private undergraduate loans 
(RBUGPRIV).  

Item-level nonresponse rates were also examined by mode of administration. There were 
significant differences between the web mode and interviewer (telephone and field) modes in the 
nonresponse rates of 16 interview items. Notably, the following income items showed higher rates 
of nonresponse among telephone and field respondents than among web respondents: income in 2008 
(RFINCOM; z = 12.89, p < .001); spouse's income in 2008 (RFINCSP; z = 8.41, p < .001); and not 
married to spouse in 2008 (RFSPNOT; z = 9.05, p < .001). 

In contrast, the following items on coders showed higher rates of nonresponse among web 

respondents than among telephone and field respondents: NPSAS original major: string (RBORGMAJ; 
z = 4.65, p < .001); NPSAS primary major: string (RBNPMAJ; z = 6.33, p < .001); NPSAS second major: 
string (RBNPMJ2; z = 4.05, p < .001); postbaccalaureate degree 1 primary major: string (RCMAJ01; 
z = 10.48, p < .001); industry: coder (RDINDCD; z = 11.56, p < .001); [REJBTP01] school: lowest grade 
level offered (RESGLO01; z = 2.17, p < .05); and [REJBTP01] school: highest grade level offered 
(RESGHI01; z = 2.23, p < .05).  

Table 28 summarizes the item-level nonresponse for items administered to at least 100 

respondents with a rate of at least 5 percent missing.

3.6  Student Interview Conclusions 

B&B:08/09 interviews were conducted from July 13, 2009 to March 12, 2010. Of the 17,170 

eligible sample members included in the B&B:08/09 student interview data collection, 16,050, or 
93 percent, were successfully located. Successful locating methods included batch searches, such as 
Telematch and CPS, and address update information provided by both sample members and their 
parents. Overall, about 7 percent of sample members required intensive tracing. Locating methods 
attempted during the B&B:08/09 interview included text message reminders and the use of social 
networking sites.  

Of the 17,170 sample members included in the B&B:08/09 student interview data collection, 
15,090, or 88 percent, completed a full, abbreviated (English or Spanish), or partial interview. About 
96 percent of all B&B:08/09 interview respondents completed the full interview. Eighty-one percent 
of interviews were completed on the Web, 16 percent of interviews were completed by telephone, 
and 3 percent were completed in field interviewing. Eighty-nine percent of base-year respondents 
completed the B&B:08/09 interview, compared with 49 percent of base-year nonrespondents. Two-
thirds (67 percent) of all completed B&B:08/09 interviews and over three-fourths (80 percent) of 
web interviews were completed during the early response phase. Base-year respondents received $30 
if they completed the interview in either the early response or nonresponse conversion phase. Base-
year nonrespondents received $50 to complete the interview. 

On average, the B&B:08/09 interview took 28 minutes to complete. On average, telephone 
interviews took the longest to complete and the Undergraduate Education section in the interview 
took the longest to complete. 

An evaluation of the quality of the data provided by the B&B:08/09 student interview 

showed that methodological features built into the instrument as well as training and supervision of 
interviewing staff aided in the successful administration of the interview. The design of assisted 
coding systems in the instrument and the training of interviewers on coders appeared successful.

Chapter 3. Student Interview Design, Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

Overall, expert coders agreed with major, occupation, and industry codes chosen in the interview 
90 percent of the time. The appearance of help text and conversion text in the instrument also 
appeared to improve question response. Help text was accessed significantly more often during 
interviews by telephone and field interviewers than by web respondents. It should be noted that 
interviewers had been encouraged to use help text, as needed, as this feature of the instrument was 
emphasized during telephone interviewer training. Eighty-five percent of the cases where conversion 
text was triggered in the interview were converted to a response after the conversion text was 
displayed. Overall, the item-level nonresponse analysis yielded 36 items out of 1,358 interview items 
with more than 5 percent missing data. 

Debriefing of tracers and field interviewers at the end of data collection indicated that 

frequent monitoring of telephone interviewers, a help desk that tracked and resolved difficulties 
encountered by sample members attempting to complete the web interview, and quality circle 
training and feedback meetings were useful as data collection quality control (QC) procedures. Most 
interviewers indicated that they felt they had all the tools necessary to successfully administer the 
B&B:08/09 student interview.

Chapter 4.  
Transcript Data Collection, Outcomes,  
and Evaluation 
B&B:08/09 collected postsecondary transcripts for the B&B:08 cohort as an official record 

of sample members’ academic experiences, including courses taken and performance in these 
courses. To ease burden on participating institutions, the B&B:08/09 transcript collection was 
combined with the transcript collection for BPS:04/09 under PETS:09. This chapter provides an 
overview of the B&B:08/09 portion of the transcript collection and will describe the processes and 
systems developed for collecting transcripts. It will also report on transcript keying and coding 
activities and the data and process evaluation procedures introduced to assure data quality. 

4.1  Transcript Data Collection and Response Rates 

A Transcript Control System (TCS) was designed to manage the transcript and other 

institution data requested from the institutions attended by the B&B:08 cohort. Institution 
contactors (ICs) served as liaisons to institutions that provided the requested materials through a 
variety of possible submission methods, including a study website. Transcripts were received for a 
total of 17,430 students. The details of transcript data collection and response rates are included in 
this section.  

4.1.1  Transcript Control System 

The integrated, web-based TCS supported each step of the B&B:08/09 transcript collection, 
including project management, communications, and tracking. The TCS comprised several transcript 
management systems: the Institution Contacting System was used to store and access data on students 
and track efforts to obtain their transcripts; the Data Receipt System managed data received on sample 
members, including transcripts and catalogs for the institutions attended; and the Keying and Coding 
System (KCS) facilitated the efficient and secure capture of data from student transcripts. See section 
4.2 for a detailed discussion of the development and use of the KCS. Transcript control system data 
were stored in SQL databases accessible for use in reporting, documenting and delivering transcript 
data. 

4.1.2  Training of Institution Contactor (IC) Staff 

Institution contacting staff consisted of eight ICs and two QCS who were responsible for 
staff supervision. Prior to the start of transcript data collection, the ICs were trained over a 2-day 
period on transcript and catalog collection, gaining cooperation, and problem resolution. Training 
included information on B&B and a review of confidentiality regulations. Activities focused on 
guidelines for interactions with institution staff, gaining cooperation, collection of catalogs and 
transcripts, and collection and receipt systems. During the transcript collection period, staff were 
briefed on their progress, asked questions, and discussed issues at weekly quality circle meetings. The 
IC training agenda is included in appendix G.

Chapter 4. Transcript Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

4.1.3  Transcript Collection Procedures 

Transcripts were requested from the 1,100 institutions where B&B sample members 

completed their bachelor’s degree requirements during the 2007–08 academic year (their NPSAS 
institution). A complete transcript was requested from this institution for each student. 

Beginning in late October 2008, a transcript request packet was sent to the director of the 

institution research office at each institution. In the absence of an office of institution research, 
packets were sent to the registrar’s office. The packet contained notification materials for transcript 
data collection (see appendix H), including the following: 

•  a letter introducing PETS:09; 
•  an introductory letter from NCES; 
•  a letter of endorsement from the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and 

Admission Officers; 

information regarding how to log on to the study’s secure website; 

•  a list of other endorsing agencies; 
• 
•  descriptions of and instructions for the various methods of providing transcripts; and 
•  excerpts from the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act that illustrated the 

transcript collection’s compliance with the legislation. 

Follow-up calls by trained ICs were placed 2 days after the initial mailing to ensure receipt of 
the packet and to answer any questions about the study. Prompting calls were made and reminder e-
mails sent, as needed, from November 2008 through July 2009.  

Transcript submission. Institutions were provided the following seven options for 

submitting transcripts:  

1.  File upload to the study website. Institutions were asked to submit electronic transcript files, 
preferably in an extensible markup language (XML) or electronic data interchange (EDI) 
format that conformed to the Postsecondary Electronic Standards Council standard. If 
the transcript data were not already in one of the two preferred formats, the institution 
was asked to convert the files before loading, or to prepare files using the file 
specifications provided on the study website. The transcript files were submitted directly 
to the secure study website. The latest technology systems were incorporated into the 
transcript website application to ensure strict adherence to NCES confidentiality 
guidelines. The web server included an SSL encryption certificate and was configured to 
force encrypted data transmission over the Internet. All of the data entry modules on the 
site were password protected, and the user was automatically logged out of the system 
after 20 minutes of inactivity. Just as with all the submission methods, once the 
transcript files were received, they were immediately moved to a secure project folder 
accessible only to a subset of project staff. 

2.  Submission of electronic transcripts by secure file transfer protocol (FTP) server. Transcript files could 

be submitted using an FTP server, which ensures an encrypted control session. As with 
the file upload, it was preferable for files to be submitted using an XML or EDI format, 
but files could be submitted in virtually any file layout. After being copied to the secure 
project folder, the files were immediately deleted from the FTP server.  

58 

B&B:08/09 Full-scale Methodology Report 

Chapter 4. Transcript Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

3.  Submission of transcripts via eSCRIP-SAFE™.  eSCRIP-SAFE™ is a third-party vendor that 
receives and electronically converts transcripts to PDF files, then stores them on a secure 
server. Institutions registered with this service send data by secure internet connection to 
the eSCRIP-SAFE™ server, where they can be downloaded only by a designated user. 
The electronic transcript files downloaded by project staff from eSCRIP-SAFE™ were 
saved only to the secure project folder. 

4.  Submission of transcript files as encrypted attachments to e-mail. Electronic transcript files could 
be emailed as attachments to the project e-mail account. Guidelines on encryption and 
creating strong passwords for transcript attachments were provided to the institutions. 
Encrypted transcript files were moved to the secure project folder and deleted from the 
e-mail folder immediately. 

5.  Submission of transcript files through a dedicated server at the University of Texas at Austin. A 
dedicated server at the University of Texas at Austin, developed to allow transcript 
exchange among registered institutions, was provided as an option to institutions 
submitting transcripts to the study. The server supported both XML and EDI formats.  

6.  Submission of transcripts via secure electronic fax. Transcripts were also accepted via secure 
electronic fax. To safeguard against information being misdirected or intercepted by 
individuals to whom access was not intended or authorized, RTI protocol only allowed 
for transcripts to be sent to an e-fax server housed in a secured data center at RTI. The 
transcript data were stored on the server as portable document files (PDFs). To ensure 
confidentiality, institutions were asked to send a test fax with nonsensitive data and to 
use a specific fax cover sheet from the project website that included a confidentiality 
statement. After being received and copied to the secure project folder, transcript files 
were deleted from the e-fax server.  

7.  Submission of transcripts via FedEx. Transcripts were also accepted via FedEx. To safeguard 

confidentiality, institution staff were instructed to redact any personally identifiable 
information from the transcript including student name, address, date of birth, and SSN 
(if present). Paper transcripts were kept in a locked file cabinet in RTI’s secure data 
receipt facility, to which only a limited number of B&B:08/09 transcript staff had access. 
After the paper transcripts were scanned and stored electronically, they were shredded.   
In addition to transcripts, other information from each institution was needed for keying and 
coding. Institutions were asked to provide academic calendar and grading system information on the 
study website. If course catalogs could not be obtained separately through institution websites or 
through CollegeSource Online, a resource for over 50,000 postsecondary institution catalogs, they 
were requested from institutions. 

Transcripts and course catalogs received were inventoried, assigned unique identifiers, 

reviewed for any problems with legibility and completeness, and logged each day in the data receipt 
system. Project staff used daily monitoring reports to review problem transcripts and ICs assisted 
with resolving transcript problems directly with institutions.  

4.1.4  Institution Website 

The PETS:09 website (figure 10) was the portal used to collect institution data and 

transcripts. The website contained information about PETS, including research topics, the transcript 
collection, how transcript data would be used, answers to frequently asked questions, and 

B&B:08/09 Full-scale Methodology Report 

59 

Chapter 4. Transcript Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

confidentiality assurances. Contact information for the transcript data collection help desk and 
project staff at RTI, as well as links to the main NCES and RTI websites, were also included on the 
home page. From the secure portion of the website, institutions could view the list of their sampled 
students, view detailed instructions for providing transcript data, and upload data. 

Various systems were incorporated into the website application to ensure strict adherence to 

NCES confidentiality guidelines, including the following: 

•  an SSL Certificate ensured secure data transmission over the Internet,  
•  all data entry modules were password protected, 
•  users were automatically logged out of the system after 20 minutes of inactivity, and 
• 

files uploaded to the secure website were immediately moved to a secure project folder 
accessible only to a subset of project staff.

4.1.5  Transcript Collection Response Rates 

Institution-level participation. Of 1,300 institutions in the transcript sample, 85 percent 
were determined to be eligible (i.e., they were confirmed as awarding bachelor’s degrees during the 
NPSAS:08 academic year). Of these 1,100 eligible institutions, 1,020 (93 percent) provided 
transcripts for the sampled students. Across the institution types represented, participation in the 
transcript collection ranged from 79 percent at the public 2-year institutions to 95 percent at the 
public 4-year non-doctorate-granting institutions. (The private nonprofit 2-year or less institutions 
demonstrated 100 percent participation but with a very small number of institutions.) The most 
common reasons cited by institutions for not participating included lacking the available staff to 
fulfill the request for transcripts and the timing of the transcript request. Table 29 provides 
institution participation rates by institution type.

Transcript submission method outcomes. Table 30 presents the distribution of 

transmission methods selected by the institutions. Providing transcripts via secure fax was the choice 
of the majority of the institutions: 61 percent of the institutions used the secure fax option. This was 
the most convenient option for most institutions that routinely generate and send out hard-copy 
transcripts. The next most common method was to upload transcripts via the institution website, 
accounting for about 20 percent of institutions. About 8 percent of institutions sent transcripts via 
FedEx and 6 percent sent transcripts as encrypted attachments via e-mail. The less common 
methods included secure FTP, used by 4 percent of institutions, and the dedicated server at the 
University of Texas at Austin and eSCRIP-SAFE™ which were used by 1 percent or less of 
institutions.

4.2  Transcript Keying and Coding 

Keying and coding of transcripts was completed using a data entry application. Several 

quality control activities evaluated the various types of data collected (e.g. courses, major/field of 
study). This section will describe keying and coding procedures as well as outcomes. 

4.2.1  Transcript Keying and Coding Procedures 

Transcript keying and coding was performed by a team of specially trained data entry 

(keyer/coder) staff using a web-based data entry application. Work was evaluated using several 
quality control activities designed for various types of data collected (e.g., courses, major/field of 
study). The keying and coding sections (figure 11) collected the following transcript information (for 
a full list of keyed and coded transcript data elements, see appendix I):  

•  Case information. Preliminary transcript information including student name, address, and 

high school graduation date.  

B&B:08/09 Full-scale Methodology Report 

63 

Chapter 4. Transcript Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

•  Schools and terms. Names of the transcript school and any transfer institutions reported on 

the transcript, terms attended at these schools, and attempted and accepted transfer 
credits. 

•  Academics. Academic honors awarded (e.g., Dean’s or President’s List) and any 

probations, by term.  

•  Tests. Institution exams (e.g., competency and placement exams) or externally 

administered exams (e.g., SAT and GRE), and related scores.  

•  Degrees and majors. Degree programs attempted or earned, such as a bachelor’s or 

associate’s degree, degree receipt dates, and honors awarded at graduation such as cum 
laude. The specific majors or fields of study for each degree were coded in this section.  

•  Courses. Key data on courses listed on transcripts, including the terms in which the 

courses were taken, course numbers and names, and grades and credit or clock hours 
earned. In this section, each course was also coded for standardization.  

Figure 11.  Keying and coding system sections: 2009 

SOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 2008/09 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal 
Study (B&B:08/09). 

 

To help ensure the quality of data keyed and coded, specific features were incorporated into 

the KCS. For example, the KCS provided links to institution course catalogs for easy reference; 
limited ranges and the types of characters input for fields such as dates and exam scores; and 
required that postsecondary institutions, majors, and courses be coded using specially designed 
coders.   

KCS coding systems. The school and major or field of study coders incorporated into the 
KCS were assisted coders identical to those used in the B&B:08/09 student interview instrument. 
The school coder used the set of institutions contained in IPEDS, developed by NCES 
(http://nces.ed.gov/IPEDS/). The major or field of study coder was based on the CIP taxonomy 
developed by NCES (http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode). CIP codes not associated with 
postsecondary majors or fields of study were removed from this coder, including codes for basic 

64 

B&B:08/09 Full-scale Methodology Report 

Chapter 4. Transcript Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

skills and developmental education, citizenship activities, health-related knowledge and skills, 
interpersonal and social skills, leisure and recreational activities, personal awareness and self-
improvement, and high school/secondary diplomas and certificates.   

The KCS course coder was similar to the KCS school and major or field of study coders, 
with the addition of certain search features. When a text string with the course title was entered, a 
keyword search based on the course title was conducted on the underlying database allowing the 
keyer/coder staff person to select the best option from a list of possible course options returned. If 
the course title did not adequately capture the description of the course in the institution catalog, 
keyer/coders could search the course coder database using keywords found in the course 
description in the institution course catalog or they could do searches by broad categories and by 
database codes. The KCS also included a feature for entering problem sheets for particular schools 
or transcripts. Problem sheets were categorized and routed to supervising staff for resolution.   

Development of the KCS course coder. The underlying database for the course coder in 

the KCS included 2,119 course codes and code definitions. Course codes were developed by 
integrating selected courses from the College Course Map taxonomy (CCM) (Adelman 2004) into 
the 2010 CIP taxonomy from NCES. PETS codes were represented by six digits in keeping with the 
CIP taxonomy: the first two digits indicated the most general category; the first four digits narrowed 
the focus to a subcategory; and the complete 6-digit code provided the most specific definition of 
the subject. Figure 12 provides a visual representation of the structure of CIP codes.  

Figure 12.  CIP code diagram: 2009 

NOTE: CIP = Classification of Instructional Programs. 
SOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 2008/09 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal 
Study (B&B:08/09). 

 

Course codes in the CCM taxonomy, which used the same 6-digit structure as the then-
current CIP, were developed through extensive transcript analysis and with input from expert 
advisors, including postsecondary faculty familiar with the fields of study. To create a 
comprehensive course coder for PETS:09, content from the CCM was incorporated into the 2010 
CIP in two ways: (1) course codes found in the CCM without equivalents in the CIP were added as 
new codes, and (2) CCM codes with equivalent CIP codes were reviewed and, when additional 
details or examples were found, they were added to the CIP definitions. The first method resulted in 
the addition of 352 unique CCM course codes to the KCS course coder. These additions were 
placed alongside related topics in the 2-digit category and 4-digit subcategory structure common to 
both the CCM and CIP taxonomies. To make these additions easily identifiable, the last two digits in 
their codes used a unique numbering scheme, starting with 98 and descending as needed. An 
example can be seen in code 01.0698 in figure 13.   

B&B:08/09 Full-scale Methodology Report 

65 

Chapter 4. Transcript Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

The second method for integrating the CCM and the 2010 CIP resulted in adding content to 

the definitions of 316 CIP codes. The additional text increased the likelihood of identifying 
appropriate course codes using the keyword searchable KCS course coder. In instances where a CIP 
code was elaborated, the CCM content was placed at the end of the CIP definition. Finally, in 
addition to content from the CCM, 47 general and other codes were added to the KCS course coder 
using KCS course coder fifth and sixth digit values of “00” for general and “99” for other, when these 
codes were not already present in the CIP. Figure 13 illustrates a representative set of codes in the 
KCS course coder.

Study (B&B:08/09). 

 

Transcript courses were originally coded using the available draft of the 2010 CIP. The 

database for the course coder in the KCS was updated when the final version of the 2010 CIP was 
released in July 2009. Compared to the draft version, the final 2010 CIP included 80 new codes, 21 
codes with different code numbers, and two codes that were deleted from the draft. For the 80 new 
codes in the final 2010 CIP, courses on transcripts previously coded with similar codes from the 
draft 2010 CIP were reviewed by keyer/coder staff to determine if they fit better into the new CIP 
codes. There were 17,778 courses previously coded with draft 2010 CIP codes that were updated to 
the final 2010 CIP codes. There were just three courses previously coded with deleted CIP codes 
from the draft 2010 CIP which, when reviewed, were assigned to similar, related codes in the final 
version of the 2010 CIP.   

4.2.2  Training of Transcript Keyer/Coder Staff 

Over the course of three separate 5-day trainings, beginning in January 2009, 71 keyer/coder 

staff were trained to use the KCS. The keyer/coder staff were supervised by five QCS who were 
responsible for administrative and management issues, as well as quality review of keyed and coded 
transcripts and keying and coding, as needed.   

Each training session began with background on B&B:08/09, review of confidentiality 

regulations, fingerprinting, and signing of notarized affidavits. These activities were followed by an 
overview and discussion of the different types of transcript formats and key data elements to be 
located and entered into the KCS. Presentations on keying and coding fundamentals were followed 
by problem-solving exercises and practice sessions. The fifth day of training consisted primarily of 
supervised keying and coding practice using actual transcripts, followed by a practicum exam on 

66 

B&B:08/09 Full-scale Methodology Report 

Chapter 4. Transcript Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

which all trainees were required to obtain 90 percent or better proficiency for certification. The 
training agenda for transcript data collection is included in appendix G.   

In conjunction with the above trainings and because of the wide variation in transcript 

layouts and information provided by the institutions, quality circle meetings were held weekly for the 
first 8 months of keying/coding. During the meetings, QCS and a group of keyer/coders were 
briefed on production and performance measures and were invited to ask questions or raise 
concerns. Topics discussed ranged from the use of specific CIP codes, to keying of the more 
problematic data elements. As the project progressed, the frequency of the quality circle meetings 
was adjusted to biweekly. 

Often as a result of feedback during quality circle meetings, additional narrowly focused 
trainings were held as needed for specific topics, such as entering multiple transcripts for sample 
members, coding of electronic transcripts, and the use of problem sheets to record issues or 
questions with transcripts. 

4.2.3  Transcript Keying and Coding Outcomes 

Keying and coding was performed on 16,070 transcripts, with one transcript per student. 

These transcripts included a total of 741,450 courses, 28,090 terms, and 17,180 degrees. Of the 
741,450 courses coded, 73 percent were coded with a specific 6-digit code. General codes were 
selected for 24 percent of the courses coded and were typically chosen for the many introductory 
level courses, while other codes were selected for 2 percent of the courses when no more specific 
code matches in the KCS course coder were found for a course on a transcript. Uncodeable courses 
accounted for 2 percent of all courses, often due to unclear course titles or inadequate information 
on course content. The results of course coding are shown in figure 14.

4.2.4  Evaluation of Transcript Keying and Coding 

Multiple evaluation steps were taken to ensure the quality of transcript data entered into the 
KCS. These activities included rekeying a sample of data elements, expert coding a sample of course

and major/field of study coding, and upcoding of text strings for institutions or other transcript data 
elements that could not be coded initially.  

Rekeying. To evaluate the reliability of transcript data keyed into the KCS, approximately 
10 percent (1,600) of the transcripts were randomly selected to be rekeyed. A subset of transcript 
data elements were rekeyed by quality control supervisors, which took approximately 10 to 15 
minutes per transcript, depending on the number of the selected data elements found on the 
transcript (e.g., the number of terms attended). Figure 15 shows agreement rates for the rekeying 
activity, organized by keying and coding section. For both rekeying and recoding activities, the 
Cohen’s kappa statistic was used to assess inter-rater reliability between the original coder and 
quality control supervisors, or expert coders. Cohen’s kappa measures the proportion of agreement 
between raters, above what would be expected by chance. Landis and Koch (1977) proposed that 
kappa scores of 0.81-1.00 be considered “near-perfect agreement,” 0.61-0.80 “substantial 
agreement,” and 0.41-0.60 “moderate agreement.”22 All of the rekeyed items have at least moderate 
agreement, with case information, terms, and degrees all within the range of near perfect agreement.

Study (B&B:08/09). 

Data collected in the test section of the KCS (exam name, date taken, and score), however, 
had a noticeably lower value for kappa (0.45) than other data elements. Further investigation into 
test data on transcripts revealed that of the 1,020 institutions that provided transcripts, only 28 
schools included Advanced Placement (AP) tests with scores on their transcripts. Instead, tests, 
particularly exams for which course credit was awarded, were often included on transcripts in a 
format more similar to courses (e.g., “AP biology, 3.0 credits”). Due to the low interrater reliability 

                                                 
22 Although Landis and Koch’s classification scheme is commonly used as a benchmark for kappa scores, there is debate regarding its 
utility and the appropriateness of kappa classification schemes, in general. See Gwet (2010), Sim and Wright (2005) and Fleiss (1981) 
for detailed discussions of criticisms and alternative classifications.

score and frequency with which test data were found on transcripts, this category of data were 
determined to be unreliable and will not be included in B&B data file because its presence on 
postsecondary transcripts was determined to be unreliable. 

Expert coding. Expert coding was performed on 71,820 courses, both to evaluate the 

reliability of coded data and to create feedback opportunities to improve data quality. Expert coding 
used more experienced (expert) staff, all of whom held at least a bachelor’s degree and who also 
performed coding in the field test study, to recode a subsample of coded courses and to provide 
feedback to keyer/coders on course code selection. Expert coding was performed from the 
beginning of the keying and coding process and continued until its conclusion so that keyer/coder 
staff could receive feedback on their performance and additional training needs could be addressed 
promptly. 

Initially, the expert coding process included two steps. In expert coding 1 (EC1), expert 
coder staff reviewed course information and selected a code, which was then compared to the 
keyer/coder’s choice. In cases where the keyer/coder and expert coder selections did not match, 
expert coding 2 (EC2) was performed to assess the reliability of EC1. EC2, in addition to being 
performed on all cases where EC1 and keyer/coder choices did not match, was also performed on a 
15 percent random sample of codes where the EC1 and keyer/coder agreed.   

EC2 was performed as a review of the quality of the EC1 staff and included review of course 

information and deciding upon the EC1 choice, the keyer/coder choice, or an entirely different 
code— to avoid potential bias, the EC2 could not identify which selection was made by the EC1 or 
keyer/coder. EC2 review of keyer/coder EC1 disagreements added reliability to the EC1 code 
selections upon which keyer/coder feedback was developed. EC2 was performed by the same 
project staff responsible for keyer/coder training and course code development.  

Based upon a sample of 3,350 disagreements between keyer/coder and EC1, EC2 agreed 

with EC1 in 60 percent of the cases, with the keyer/coder in 32 percent of the cases, and selected a 
different code (neither the EC1 nor the keyer/coder’s choice) in 9 percent of the cases. The EC2 
staff agreed with expert coder choices significantly more than the keyer/coder choices: 
χ²(1, N = 3,350) = 308.22, p < 0.01).  

As with keying and coding, expert coding was performed in batches by school. Courses were 

not expert coded until all of a school’s transcripts had been keyed and coded. For both EC1 and 
EC2, expert coders reviewed course number and name and had access to course catalogs to make 
coding decisions.   

For the purpose of reviewing keyer/coder work and providing feedback, expert coding was 

performed on both random and cluster samples of courses. EC1 was performed on a random 10 
percent sample of all courses from each school. For schools with fewer than 10 total courses, all 
courses were expert coded. Cluster sampling was used to select courses coded with other codes (e.g., 
26.0299, biochemistry, biophysics and molecular biology, other). Courses coded as needs review or 
uncodeable were also reviewed in expert coding.   

Interrater reliability for course coding was assessed using 5,000 courses randomly selected 

for calculating agreement statistics. The kappa statistic was used to assess interrater reliability 
between the original coder and expert coders. Expert coding results are shown in figure 16. 
Agreement rates are shown at three levels of specificity: 2-digit, 4-digit, and 6-digit. At the 2-digit 
level, the kappa statistic indicates near-perfect agreement between keyer/coder and expert coder. At 
both the 4- and 6-digit levels, the kappa statistic indicates substantial agreement.

Level of specificity

Review of “other” course codes. For the first six months of keying, courses coded using 

the “other” category in the PETS:09 coder were reviewed by expert coders with the goal of 
minimizing the use of the category. Keyer/coder training emphasized that “other” codes should be 
reserved for courses that fit within a 4-digit subject area but for which more specific 6-digit codes in 
that series were not appropriate. “Other” was not intended for coding problematic courses or those 
for which additional analysis would result in a more accurate code. Expert coders provided direct 
feedback to keyer/coders on cases for which there were more appropriate coding choices.      

In addition to the expert coding performed, “other” codes were also reviewed to determine 
if additional codes should be added to the PETS coder. The PETS course taxonomy included 231 
courses with an “other” designation, such as 31.0599, “Health and Physical Education/Fitness, 
Other,” or 23.9999, “English Language and Literature/Letters, Other.” A review of the courses 
coded as “other” was undertaken to determine if there were common subjects within the codes that 
would merit introduction of new codes. The median number of uses of “other” for all course codes 
was 132. This median was used as the threshold for adding a new code: if 132 instances of the same 
subject could be identified within the courses coded using the “other” code, a new code would be 
added. However, a review of “other” codes did not identify any subjects that met this threshold, so 
no new codes were added.   

Upcoding and reliability recoding for major/field of study. Text strings for 158 entries 

for field of study that were not coded by keyer/coders were later reviewed by project staff to 
determine if an appropriate code could be identified. In addition to this upcoding activity, a random 
sample of 2,745 coded majors was also included in this process as a key-rekey step to evaluate the 
reliability of the field of study data. The results are shown in figure 17. For the randomly selected 
cases, the coder and recoder agreed in 90 percent of the cases.  For the uncoded majors, project staff 
was able to identify a major code in 63 percent of the cases. In 22 percent of the uncoded cases, data 
on the transcripts were too vague to identify an appropriate code and, in 15 percent of cases, the 
original code selection was correct.

Upcoding for institutions and variables with “other, specify” options. Uncoded text 
strings for institutions were reviewed by project staff to determine if an appropriate code could be 
identified. This task was performed on 2,020 cases by staff with greater familiarity with 
postsecondary institutions and with additional resources for researching school names and locations. 
The results of this institution upcoding are shown in figure 18. In 57 percent of the cases, the 
institution could not be identified in IPEDS, and thus remained uncodeable. Analysts were able to 
code 43 percent of the previously uncodeable institutions while for less than 1 percent of cases, the 
school name could not be identified at all.

tests (e.g., SAT),  
term honors (e.g., Dean’s List),  
term probations (e.g., academic probation),  

In addition to institutions, transcript data elements with “other, specify” options included:  
•  noncourse credits awarded (e.g., course credit for Advanced Placement tests),  
• 
• 
• 
•  degree programs (e.g., associate’s),  
•  grades (e.g., R),  
•  bachelor’s degree types (e.g., Bachelor of Education), and  
•  degree honors (e.g., with distinction).  
All items coded as “other, specify” were reviewed by analysts to determine if the text strings 

could fit into existing choices or if there were common strings that merited addition of a new 
choice. For example, Bachelor of Education was not included in a drop-down menu for bachelor 
type, therefore it was entered as a text string under “Other, specify.” When the value appeared 
repeatedly as a text string, it was assigned as a category and upcoded accordingly. Table 32 shows the 
results of “other, specify” upcoding. The total number of cases is shown for each data element along 
with the number and percent that were upcoded.

Keyer/Coder Staff Debriefing. Near the conclusion of keying and coding, a debriefing 
focus group was held with seven keyer/coders who had collectively keyed and coded more than 
10,000 transcripts. Two participants had also performed duties as QCS. Focus group participants 
agreed that the keyer/coder training had been helpful and prepared them for the task. They also 
found quality circle notes and meetings to be useful. The keying and coding system facilitated entry 
of transcript data, although some data elements in the system were not commonly found on 
transcripts, such as “transfer credits for grade point average” and “state basic skills tests.”  

Regarding course coding, focus group participants found the search features of the KCS to 

be useful, but certain course subjects were difficult to code, such as engineering and computer 
courses, as well as some education courses, when it was difficult to discern whether the course was 

72 

B&B:08/09 Full-scale Methodology Report 

Chapter 4. Transcript Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

about learning the topic itself or learning about how to teach the topic. Finally, focus group 
participants indicated that identifying remedial courses was sometimes difficult, for instance when 
the course description sounded like it could be remedial but without stating so explicitly. In such 
cases, keyer/coders were sometimes able to confirm a course was remedial by noting a grade greater 
than an F with no credits awarded.   

4.2.5  Timing of Transcript Keying and Coding 

Transcript keying and coding was conducted from January 19, 2009, to June 11, 2010. On 
average each transcript took 88 minutes to key and code. The time to complete keying and coding 
varied by institution sector, ranging from a 75 minute average for transcripts from private, for-profit 
2 years or more institutions, to 98 minutes for transcripts from private, nonprofit, 4-year non-
doctorate granting institutions (table 33).

4.3  Transcript Data Collection Conclusions 

A transcript collection was conducted for B&B:08/09 as part of PETS:09. Institution 
contacting staff were trained to facilitate the data collection process, using a transcript control 
system to aid institution representatives in the submission of transcripts. A PETS:09 website was 
also developed to aid institutions in the submission of transcripts, providing instructions for several 
secure electronic transmission methods, fax, and FedEx. Data receipt staff completed initial 
processing and quality review of the transcript data and institution contacting staff communicated 
with staff at postsecondary institutions to resolve any missing data or problems. 

Transcript keying and coding was performed using a specially designed keying and coding 
system that was divided into sections for the entry of data for case information, schools and terms, 
academics, tests, degrees and majors, and courses. A postdata collection debriefing of keyer/coder 
staff indicated the system was effective for transcript data entry. The PETS coder, created by 

B&B:08/09 Full-scale Methodology Report 

73 

Chapter 4. Transcript Data Collection, Outcomes, and Evaluation 

merging 2010 CIP and 2003 CCM, provided a detailed code taxonomy for the coding of courses by 
subject. 

The 5-day keyer/coder training and ongoing feedback offered through quality circle 

meetings prepared staff to reliably perform keying and coding tasks. All staff passed the proficiency 
test at the conclusion of training, and the results of the keying and course coding interrater reliability 
assessments indicate substantial agreement between keyer/coders and expert coders. Recoding of 
the random sample of major/field of study data further supported the reliability of the data. 

Upcoding was performed on all uncoded institutions and additional data elements where 

“other, specify” options were available, such as noncourse credit awarded, tests, honors, probations, 
and degree programs. Upcoding added greater detail to data collected. Courses coded with “other” 
codes were reviewed for common subjects, but none were found in great enough numbers to add 
new course codes.

Postdata Collection Data File 
Processing Activities 

The data files for B&B:08/09 contain student-level data collected from administrative 

databases, student interviews, and transcripts. These data are available to users in two ways. A set of 
restricted research files, fully documented, are available to restricted data licensees on a CD from 
NCES. Tables and regression analyses can be run by any user through the NCES online application 
PowerStats, which also contains variable documentation. PowerStats is available online via the 
DataLab site at http://nces.ed.gov/datalab/index.aspx. This chapter describes each file and details 
the editing and documentation processes applied to each. 

5.1  Administrative Record Matching 

In addition to the student interview, data collection for B&B:08/09 included record 

matching to the CPS, the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS), and the NSC 
StudentTracker database. This section provides a discussion of the observed match rates for these 
three databases. 

5.1.1  Central Processing System 

The CPS contains data provided to the U.S. Department of Education by students and their 

families when they complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Successful 
record matching to CPS can occur only for sample members who were federal student financial aid 
applicants for the years requested. Matching for B&B:08/09 was to CPS data for the 2008–09 and 
2009–10 financial aid years, using a sample member’s SSN concatenated with the first two letters of 
the last name as the CPS ID. The percentage of sample members who matched to CPS for the 
2008–09 academic year was about 24 percent. For 2009–10, the rate was approximately 23 percent. 
As expected, 2009–10 match rates were lower than those for 2008–09 because fewer members of 
the B&B:08 cohort continued to be enrolled in postsecondary education and to apply for federal aid. 
Table 34 shows the CPS matching results.

5.1.2  National Student Loan Data System 

NSLDS matching was performed by the NSLDS contractor at the request of the U.S. 
Department of Education, using names, SSNs and dates of birth provided by RTI. Successful 
matching to NSLDS could occur only for sample members who were awarded federal loans, Pell 
Grants, TEACH Grants, SMART Grants, or ACGs. NSLDS files are historical, so information 
about a student’s receipt of such loans and grants was available not only for the current academic 
year but also for any applicable prior years. Consequently, historical match rates reported for the 
B&B:08/09 sample members do not necessarily reflect only the 2009–10 academic year. The federal 
loan match rate was about 75 percent and the match rate for Pell Grants was about 52 percent. The 
number of sample members matching to the data system for ACGs or SMART Grants was about 19 
percent, while the match rate for TEACH Grants was less than 1 percent. This is not surprising, 
given that less than 15 percent of our respondents reported in the interview that they were currently 
teaching or had taught since graduating. Table 35 summarizes the match rates observed for the 
B&B:08/09 sample members.

5.1.3  National Student Clearinghouse 

In addition to the CPS and NSLDS file matching, the B&B:08/09 sample was matched to 

the NSC StudentTracker database, which provides information on postsecondary enrollment, 
degree, and certificate records on behalf of participating postsecondary institutions. In order to 
perform the match, RTI supplied SSNs, names, and dates of birth for sample members to the NSC. 
Overall, a record match for a student’s enrollment at any NSC-participating institution was obtained 
for about 94 percent of the B&B:08/09 sample. Match results in table 36 are based on enrollment 
and degree records from all participating institutions for the 2002–03 academic year through the 
2008–09 academic year.

5.2  B&B:08/09 Main Study Data Files 

The primary analysis file, from which PowerStats was constructed, contains data for 15,050 

respondents. The first data release was adjudicated and approved for public release July 20, 2011. 
The primary analysis file contains over 400 variables, developed from multiple sources. Throughout 
the data collection period, data were processed and examined for QC purposes. Editing of student 
data began shortly after the start of web data collection, when procedures and programs for this 
purpose were first developed. Anomalous values were investigated and resolved, where appropriate, 
through the use of data corrections and logical recodes. Interim files were delivered to the NCES for 
review throughout the data collection period. 

The restricted-use CD for B&B:08/09 contains the following files, each of which can be 

linked by the student’s study ID:23  

•  B&B:08/09 analysis file. Contains analytic variables derived from all B&B data sources 

and selected direct student interview variables available as of the initial release of 
B&B:08/09 PowerStats.  

•  B&B:08/09 student data file. Contains student interview data collected from 15,050 

respondents. Topics include eligibility, undergraduate and graduate education, 
employment, teaching and background. 

•  B&B:08/09 undergraduate institution data file. Contains undergraduate institution and degree 
data obtained from the B&B:08/09 student interview for all respondents. It is a student-
level file; however, a student can have more than one record in the file. There is a 
separate record for each degree obtained from each postsecondary institution that the 
student attended between the time they graduated from high school and the time they 
graduated with their bachelor's degree (the maximum number of reported institutions for 
any one respondent was seven).

5.4  Data Editing  

The B&B:08/09 data, including data from the transcript component, were edited using 
procedures developed and implemented for previous studies sponsored by NCES, including the 
base-year study, NPSAS:08. Following data collection, the information collected in the student 
instrument and in transcripts was subjected to various QC checks and examinations. For example, in 
the student interview these checks were conducted to confirm that the collected data reflected 
appropriate item routing (skip patterns). Another evaluation involved examination of all variables with 
missing data and substitution of specific values to indicate the reason for the missing data. For 
example, in the student interview data, an item may not have been applicable to particular students, a 
respondent may not have known the answer to the question, or a respondent may have skipped the 
item entirely (table 37).

Data missing1 

Skip-pattern relationships in the interview database were examined by methodically cross-
tabulating gate items and their associated nested items. In many instances, gate-nest relationships 
spanned multiple levels within the interview: Items nested within a gate question may themselves 
have been gate items for additional items. Consequently, validating the gate-nest relationships often 
required several iterations and many multi-way cross-tabulations to ensure the proper data were 
captured. Gate-nest relationships were also preserved and edited appropriately in the transcript data 
files; however, fewer of these relationships exist in those data. 

The data cleaning and editing process for the B&B:08/09 data files involved a multistage 

process that consisted of the following:  

1.  Blank or missing data were replaced with -9 for all variables in the interview and 

transcript databases. A one-way frequency distribution of every variable was 
reviewed to confirm that no missing or blank values remained. These same one-way 
frequencies revealed any out-of-range, or outlier, values, which were replaced with a 
-6 value (e.g., hourly wages of $0.10, rather than $10.00). Creating SAS formats from 
expected values and the associated value labels also revealed any categorical outliers. 
Descriptive statistics were produced for all continuous variables. All values that were 
less than zero were temporarily recoded to missing, and the minimum, median, 
maximum, and mean values were examined to assess reasonableness of responses; 
anomalous data patterns were investigated and corrected, as necessary. For 
transcripts, missing data were also replaced with a -9 (e.g., if high school graduation 
date did not appear on the transcript) and one-way frequencies were reviewed for 
any outlier values and also given a -6 value (e.g., credit hours of 100 per course, rather 
than 3). 

2.  Legitimate skips were identified through the use of interview source code and 

flowcharts. Gate-nest relationships were defined to replace -9s (data missing, reason 
unknown) with -3s (not applicable), as appropriate. Two-way cross-tabulations between 
each gate-nest combination were evaluated; high numbers of nonreplaced -9 codes 
were investigated to ensure skip-pattern integrity. Nested values were further 
checked to reveal instances in which the legitimate skip code overwrote valid data, 
which typically occurred if a respondent answered a gate question and the 
appropriate nested items but then reverted to change the value of the gate to one 
that opened on an alternate path of nested items. Because responses to the first 
nested items remained in the database, they required editing. For transcripts, gate-
nest relationships were limited; however, -3 values were set for inapplicable items. 

80 

B&B:08/09 Full-scale Methodology Report 

Chapter 5. Postdata Collection Data File Processing Activities 

For example, if a transcript indicated that the student was still working on the degree, 
then a -3 value was given to the degree date variable.  

3.  Variables were formatted (e.g., dates were formatted as YYYYMM), and time units 

were standardized for items that collected amounts of time in multiple units. In 
addition, any new codes assigned by expert coders reviewing IPEDS, elementary and 
secondary school, industry, occupation, and major codes from the interview 
(including those strings that could not be coded during the interview) were merged 
back with the interview data files. Similarly, any new codes assigned by the expert 
coder reviewing the IPEDS, major, minor, concentration and other specify strings 
from the transcript data were merged back with the transcript data files.  Also at this 
stage, logical recodes were performed when the value of missing items could be 
determined from answers to previous questions or preloaded values. For example, if 
a student was not currently repaying education loans, then the monthly payment 
amount was recoded to $0. For transcripts, missing IPEDS, major, and course codes 
were reviewed by expert coders.  

Concurrently with data cleaning, documentation was developed for both interview and 

transcript data to detail question text, response options, logical recoding, and the “applies to” text 
for each delivered variable (for documentation information, see the student interview facsimile in 
appendix D). 

5.5  Data Perturbation 

To protect the confidentiality of NCES data that contain information about specific 
individuals and to minimize disclosure risks, B&B:08/09 data were subject to perturbation 
procedures. Perturbation procedures, which have been approved by the NCES Disclosure Review 
Board, preserve the central tendency estimates but may result in slight increases in nonsampling 
errors.   

All respondents were given a positive probability of being selected for swapping. 

Perturbation was carried out under specific targeted, but undisclosed, swap rates. In data swapping, 
the values of the variables being swapped are exchanged between carefully selected pairs of records: 
a target record and a donor record. Swapping variables were selected from all questionnaire items. 
Because perturbation of the B&B:08/09 data could have changed the relationships between 
data items, an extensive data quality check was carried out to assess and limit the impact of swapping 
on these relationships. For example, a set of correlations for a variety of variables was evaluated pre- 
and posttreatment to verify that the swapping did not greatly affect the associations. 

5.6  Statistical Imputations 

All variables from the student interview data and the derived variables in PowerStats with 

missing data were imputed. Imputed data are available in both PowerStats and the restricted derived 
data file. Derived variables obtained from student transcript data and the variables included in the 
remaining restricted files were not imputed. The variables were split into six batches to facilitate and 
expedite imputation, and a consistent imputation methodology was employed for each batch. Some 

B&B:08/09 Full-scale Methodology Report 

81 

Chapter 5. Postdata Collection Data File Processing Activities 

of the B&B respondents had missing NPSAS data,26 so these NPSAS variables were imputed first. 
These NPSAS variables were then used as part of the imputation process for the B&B variables. 
The general imputation methodology consisted of three steps. The first step, if applicable, 

was logical or deterministic imputation. That is, if the imputed value could be deduced from the 
logical relationships with other variables, then that information was used to deterministically impute 
the value for the recipient. The next step was the use of a tree-based methodology, or in a few cases 
a response propensity model, to create imputation classes. The final step used hot deck27 imputation 
to stochastically impute missing values from donors within the identified imputation classes. 

Variables requiring imputation were imputed sequentially. However, some variables that 
were related substantively or had similar levels of missing response were grouped together into 
blocks, and the variables within a block were imputed simultaneously. The order in which variables, 
or blocks of variables, were imputed was primarily based on the level of missing data. The variables 
with lower levels of missing data were imputed before the variables with higher levels of missing 
data. When a variable was selected for imputation based on its level of missing data, three specific 
pieces of information were evaluated. First, logical consistency was checked to make sure that any 
known relationships were maintained throughout the imputation process. Second, the pattern of 
missing data were evaluated to determine whether other variables should be included to create a 
block of variables requiring imputation. Finally, the imputation class variables and sorting variables 
were identified. 

All stochastic imputations used a tree-based methodology to create imputation classes and 

the weighted sequential hot-deck (WSHD) methodology (Cox 1980; Iannacchione 1982) within 
imputation classes to replace missing values. The imputation classes were formed using 
nonparametric classification trees (Breiman et al. 1984). The nonparametric classification trees 
formed imputation classes from a prediction model based on the observations with valid values for 
the variable requiring imputation. The nonparametric classification tree recursively split the cases 
into homogenous groups, which were used to define the imputation classes. The observations with 
missing values for the variable to be imputed were assigned their imputation class based on the same 
variables used in the tree splits. 

The WSHD methodology replaced missing data with valid data from a donor record within 
an imputation class. The WSHD methodology also incorporated sorting within imputation class for 
additional control and uses the sample weight of each record in the donor selection process. The 
imputation classes in the application of the WSHD methodology were formed by identifying 
variables related to the variable requiring imputation. Data were sorted within each imputation class 
to increase the chance of obtaining a close match between donor and recipient. Within each 
imputation class, the hot-deck process searched for donors sequentially, starting with the recipient 
and progressing up and down the sorted file to find the set of eligible donors from which a random 
selection of a donor was made. The process was weighted since it incorporated the sample weight of 
each record in the search and selection routine, using the methodology described in Cox (1980). 

Imputation diagnostics consisted of four checks: number of times a donor was used, overall 

imputation checks, imputation checks by class variables, and multivariate consistency checks. The 
check for the number of times a donor was used was to ensure that donors were used a reasonable 

                                                 
26 Some NPSAS data were missing for some B&B respondents because they did not respond to NPSAS but did respond to B&B, 
were identified in NPSAS as graduate students, or were not identified in NPSAS as potential B&B cases. 
27 The term hot deck refers to the fact that the set of potential donors comes from the same data set. In contrast, cold deck imputation 
refers to the fact that the donors come from an external data set or source.

number of times. Using a donor too many times might indicate that an imputation class had too few 
donors, and the class needed to be enlarged. The overall imputation checks compared the 
distributions, weighted and unweighted, for each level of the imputed variable before and after 
imputation. Differences of 5 percent or more were flagged and examined to see if changes should be 
made to the imputation specification. The imputation checks by class variables compared the 
distributions, weighted and unweighted, for each level of the imputed variable in the defined 
imputation classes before and after the imputation. Differences of 5 percent or more were flagged 
for further review. Finally, multivariate consistency checks ensured that relationships between 
variables were maintained and that any special instructions for the imputation were implemented 
properly. 

If any of the four aforementioned diagnostic checks indicated a problem, i.e., a donor was 

used too many times, substantial deviation from the weighted sums, or any identified 
inconsistencies, the imputation process was revised and rerun. Some results of the imputation 
process are provided in Appendix J, which presents the percentage missing for each variable subject 
to imputation, as well as pre- and postimputation distributions for all of these variables. Appendix M 
shows that approximately 13 percent of the variables with a response rate less than 85 percent 
showed statistically significant estimated bias between the pre- and postimputation means and 
distributions (see section 6.4.2 for more details). 

5.7  Composite and Derived Variable Construction  

Analysts created the main study analytic variables by examining the data available for each 
student from the various data sources, prioritizing the data sources on an item-by-item basis, and 
reconciling discrepancies within and between sources. In some cases, the derived or composite 
variables were created by simple assignment of a value from the available source with the highest 
priority. In other cases, interview items were recoded or otherwise summarized to create a derived 
variable. Similar procedures were used for transcript analytic variables using only data from 
transcripts and institutions providing transcripts.  Details about the creation of each variable appear 
in the variable descriptions contained in the ECB and PowerStats. For a listing of the set of analysis 
variables derived for B&B:08/09, see appendix K.

Chapter 6.  
Weighting and Variance Estimation 

This chapter provides information pertaining to the weighting procedures for B&B:08/09. 
The development of statistical analysis weights for the B&B:08/09 sample is discussed in section 
6.1. Analysis procedures that can be used to produce design-unbiased estimates of sampling 
variances are discussed in section 6.2, including variances computed using Taylor series and 
bootstrap replication techniques. Section 6.2 also describes how the Taylor series strata and primary 
sampling unit (PSU) variables were constructed, and how the bootstrap replicate weights were 
constructed. Section 6.3 gives weighted and unweighted response rates. Section 6.4 discusses the 
accuracy of B&B:08/09 estimates for precision and the potential for nonresponse bias. 

6.1  Analysis Weights 

The weights for analyzing the B&B:08/09 data were derived from the NPSAS:08 weight, 
because the B&B:08/09 sample members are a subset of the NPSAS:08 sample. As described in 
chapter 2, a stratified sample of 500 NPSAS:08 student interview nonrespondents was selected with 
probabilities proportional to their NPSAS:08 sampling weight. The weight for these cases was 
adjusted for the subsampling. Three weights were developed for analyzing data from the B&B:08/09 
data collection. One weight was developed for analyzing sample members who responded to the 
B&B:08/09 interview. A second weight was developed for analyzing cases with transcript data. A 
third weight was developed for analyzing cases with both interview and transcript data. The weights 
were adjusted for nonresponse and were also raked to IPEDS and NPSAS:08 control totals. This 
section describes the steps that were followed in order to develop each weight. 

6.1.1  Analysis Weight for Cases With Student Interview Data 

A B&B:08/09 respondent is someone who has a completed, partial, or abbreviated 
interview. The B&B:08/09 sample consisted of 18,500 students. At the conclusion of the 
B&B:08/09 data collection, 15,050 students were initially determined to be eligible respondents, 
2,120 were nonrespondents, 1,320 were ineligible, and 10 were deceased.  

The 2007–08 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:08) Full-scale Methodology Report 

(Cominole et al. 2010) (hereinafter referred to as the NPSAS:08 Full-scale Methodology Report) 
describes the development of the NPSAS study weight. The statistical analysis weight compensated 
for the unequal probability of selection of institutions and students in the NPSAS:08 sample. The 
weight also adjusted for multiplicity at the institution and student levels, unknown student eligibility, 
nonresponse, and poststratification. The institution weight was computed and then used as a 
component of the student weight. A weight was computed for NPSAS:08 respondents as the 
product of the following 10 weight components: 

1.  institution sampling weight (WT1); 
2.  institution multiplicity adjustment (WT2); 
3.  institution poststratification adjustment (WT3); 
4.  institution nonresponse adjustment (WT4); 
5.  student sampling weight (WT5); 

B&B:08/09 Full-scale Methodology Report  

85 

Chapter 6. Weighting and Variance Estimation 

6.  student multiplicity adjustment (WT6); 
7.  student unknown eligibility adjustment (WT7); 
8.  student not located adjustment (WT8); 
9.  student other nonresponse adjustment (WT9); and 
10. student poststratification adjustment (WT10). 
The B&B:08/09 sample contains both NPSAS study respondents and nonrespondents. 

Therefore, the B&B:08/09 base weight was formed as the product of the first seven of these 
adjustment factors.  

The subsample of 500 NPSAS:08 student interview nonrespondents was selected with 
probabilities proportional to the NPSAS:08 student weight. The B&B:08/09 base weight was 
multiplied by the inverse of this selection probability for the subsampled cases to obtain the weight 
for cases in the sample. 

An adjustment was made for interview nonresponse using a model-based constrained 

logistic weighting procedure. The weights were then calibrated to IPEDS and weight sums from 
NPSAS:08, which had been calibrated to IPEDS and external control totals as described in the 
NPSAS:08 Full-scale Methodology Report.28 The procedure WTADJUST in SUDAAN (RTI, 2008) 
was used to implement the nonresponse and calibration adjustments. This weighting methodology is 
described by Folsom and Singh (2000).  

The adjustment for nonresponse was performed in multiple steps because the predictors of 
response propensity are potentially different for interview refusals and other nonrespondents. Using 
multiple steps of nonresponse adjustment can achieve greater reduction in nonresponse bias than a 
single-step adjustment. 

The first stage of adjustment for interview nonresponse was an adjustment for refusal. The 

refusal adjustment model included the 17,160 eligible cases who were not deceased; the response 
(nonrefusal) indicator was set to 1 for the 16,450 interview respondents and other nonrespondents 
and to 0 for the 720 cases who were interview refusals. Independent variables were chosen that were 
considered to be predictive of response status and were nonmissing for interview respondents, 
refusals, and other nonrespondents. Variables for the model include the frame and survey design 
variables that were used for the NPSAS:08 weight adjustments and other data known for both the 
respondents and nonrespondents. Candidate predictor variables include: 

institution control; 
region; 
institution enrollment from IPEDS file (categorical); 

• 
• 
• 
•  Pell Grant receipt (yes/no); 
•  Pell Grant amount (categorical); 
•  Stafford Loan receipt (yes/no); 

                                                 
28 Calibration in this chapter generally refers to adjusting the weights to weight sums, and poststratification generally refers to 
adjusting the weights to external totals. However, these terms are sometimes used interchangeably when referring to both types of 
adjustments at the same time.

Variables initially included in the nonresponse modeling included all of the candidate 

in field cluster area (yes/no); 

predictor variables as well as certain important interaction terms. To detect important interactions 
for the nonresponse model, a Chi-squared automatic interaction detection (CHAID) analysis was 
performed on the predictor variables. The CHAID analysis divided the data into segments that 
differed with respect to the response variable. The segmentation process first divided the sample 
into groups based on categories of the most significant predictor of response. It then split each of 
these groups into smaller subgroups based on other predictor variables. It also merged categories of 
a variable that were found to be nonsignificant. CHAID was run for up to three segments, resulting 
in the identification of two-way and three-way interactions. Variables that made up the CHAID 
interaction terms were NPSAS response status, number of times an answering machine was 
encountered, whether the student was in a field cluster area, counts of phone numbers and e-mail 
addresses we have for a student, Stafford Loan receipt, and PLUS amount. This initial model did not 
converge, but as many variables as possible were retained in the model. 

Table 38 presents the predictor variables used in the model to adjust the weight for refusals 

and the average weight adjustment factors resulting from these variables. The refusal weight 
adjustment factors have the following characteristics: 

•  minimum: 1.00; 
•  median: 1.02; and 
•  maximum: 2.17.

The second stage of adjustment for interview nonresponse was an adjustment for other 
interview nonresponse, given that the student did not refuse. The other nonresponse adjustment 
model included the 16,450 interview respondents and other nonrespondents; the response 
(nonrefusal) indicator was set to 1 for the 15,050 interview respondents and to 0 for the 1,400 cases 
who were other nonrespondents. Candidate predictor variables were the same as those listed above 
for the first nonresponse adjustment model. As in the refusal adjustment, a CHAID analysis was 
performed on the predictor variables to detect important interactions. Variables that made up the 
CHAID interaction terms were NPSAS response status, number of times an answering machine was 
encountered, whether the student was in a field cluster area, and counts of phone numbers, e-mail 
addresses, and mailing addresses we have for a student. This initial model also did not converge, but 
as many variables as possible were retained in the model. 

Table 39 shows the predictor variables used in the model to adjust the weight for other 

nonrespondents and the average weight adjustment factors resulting from these variables. The other 
nonresponse weight adjustment factors have the following characteristics: 

•  minimum: 1.00; 
•  median: 1.03; and 
•  maximum: 4.49.

B&B:08/09 Full-scale Methodology Report 

Chapter 6. Weighting and Variance Estimation 

To ensure population coverage and consistency with NPSAS:08, the B&B:08/09 interview 

weights were further adjusted to control totals. Variables used to define the control totals were 
similar to those used for the poststratification adjustments for NPSAS:08. The control totals for the 
B&B:08/09 weights were obtained using the weighted sums from NPSAS:08 (using the NPSAS:08 
study weights) for these variables for the full B&B cohort (including ineligible and deceased 
students). The following variables were used in defining control totals from NPSAS:08 weight sums:  

total amount of Pell Grants awarded;30 and 

•  number of Stafford Loan recipients by institution control;29 
• 
•  amount of PLUS grants awarded by institution control. 
Additionally, control totals were formed from IPEDS counts of bachelor’s degree recipients 

for institution control, gender, and major. The following variables were used in defining control 
totals from IPEDs: 

fall 2007 recipients of baccalaureate degree by gender; 
fall 2007 recipients of baccalaureate degree by institution control; and 
fall 2007 recipients of baccalaureate degree by major (12 categories). 

• 
• 
• 
The control totals from NPSAS include cases who became ineligible or were deceased. 

Because of this, the ineligible and deceased cases were included in the calibration adjustment to the 
NPSAS totals but not the IPEDS totals. After the adjustment, the ineligible and deceased cases were 
dropped from the file; the sum of the final weights estimates the number of the NPSAS:08 
population who were eligible for B&B and were still alive at the time of the B&B:08/09 interview.  

As part of the calibration process, students with extreme (outlier) weights had different 

bounds on their adjustment factors to accomplish weight trimming and smoothing in the same step 
as calibration. Extreme weights were identified as weights greater than the median weight + 3 times 
the interquartile range or less than the median weight - 3 times the interquartile range. Weight values 
outside of these bounds were trimmed to the bounds. 

Table 40 shows the variables used for the calibration, the values of the control totals, and the 
average weight adjustment factors for each variable. The last column of table 3 shows the sum of the 
weights after removing the cases who were ineligible or deceased at the time of the B&B:08/09 data 
collection. Statistics for the weight adjustment factors are the following 

•  minimum: 0.05; 
•  median: 1.62; and 
•  maximum: 9.32. 

The response adjusted, calibrated interview weight is the variable WTA000 on the data file. 

                                                 
29 NPSAS:08 weights were controlled to total Stafford Loan amounts disbursed in addition to the number of Stafford Loan recipients, 
but the B&B calibration model would not converge with both of these included. 
30 The calibration model would not converge with amount of Pell Grants awarded by institution control, so total amount of Pell 
Grants awarded was used instead.

To assess the overall predictive ability of the nonresponse model, a Receiver Operating 

Characteristic (ROC) curve was used (Hanley and McNeil 1982). The ROC provides a measure of 
how well the model correctly classified individuals of known response type. For a more detailed 
example of the use of the ROC curve in nonresponse modeling, see Iannacchione (2003). The ROC 
curve was developed by calculating, for any specified probability, c, two proportions: 

• 

• 

the proportion of respondents with a predicted probability of response greater than c; 
and 
the proportion of nonrespondents with a predicted probability of response greater than 
c. 

The predicted probability of response for each student was the predicted response 

probability from the weight adjustment model. The plot of the first probability against the second, 
for c ranging from 0 to 1, resulted in the ROC curve shown in figure 1. The area under the curve 
measures the probability that a randomly chosen pair of observations—one respondent and one 
nonrespondent—will be correctly ranked. The probability of a correct pairwise ranking is the same 
quantity that is estimated by the nonparametric Wilcoxon statistic. The null hypothesis associated 
with the Wilcoxon statistic is that the variable is not a useful discriminator between the respondent 
and nonrespondent populations. This corresponds to the null hypothesis that the predicted response 
probability of a respondent is just as likely to be smaller than the predicted response probability of a 
nonrespondent as it is to be greater. Thus, if the null hypothesis is true, the ROC curve will be a 
diagonal line that reflects the equally likely chance of making a correct or incorrect decision, and the 
area under the curve will be 0.5.  If the null hypothesis is not true, the ROC curve will rise above the 
diagonal and the area under the curve will be significantly greater than 0.5. Figure 19 shows that the 
area under the ROC curve is 0.82 such that 82 percent of the time (or more than 8 of 10 pairings), 
the predicted probabilities give the correct classification. The ROC area of 0.82 equals the value of 
the Wilcoxon test statistic; based on this result we reject the null hypothesis of no predictive ability 
(p < 0.05). This level of discrimination implies that the variables used in the model are highly 
informative, but not definite predictors of a sample student’s overall response propensity. The

predicted probabilities of response (c) were obtained as the product of the predicted response 
probabilities obtained at both of the nonresponse adjustment steps. Note that for the second step 
(other nonresponse adjustment), predicted probabilities were not directly available for students who 
had already been dropped from the model because, in the previous step, they refused. For these 
students, their predicted probability was set equal to the mean of the predicted probabilities of 
students still in the model.

6.1.2  Analysis Weight for Cases With Transcript Data 

A weight was also constructed for analyzing the cases with transcript data. Of the 17,170 
students who were eligible for B&B:08/09, 10 were deceased, 16,070 had a transcript  from the 
NPSAS school, and the remaining 1,090 were considered nonrespondents for this weight.  

As with the weight described in section 6.1.1, the base weight was formed as the product of 

the first seven of the NPSAS:08 weight adjustment factors. An adjustment was made for 
nonresponse using a model-based constrained logistic weighting procedure, then the weights were 
calibrated to the sums of the B&B:08/09 interview weights for eligible cases. The procedure 
WTADJUST in SUDAAN was used to implement the nonresponse and calibration adjustments.  

96 

B&B:08/09 Full-scale Methodology Report 

Chapter 6. Weighting and Variance Estimation 

The first adjustment was for nonresponse, that is, not having transcript data.31 The 

adjustment model included the 17,160 eligible cases who were not deceased, with the response 
indicator set to 1 for the 16,070 cases with transcript data and set to 0 for the 1,090 cases who were 
nondeceased transcript nonrespondents. Predictor variables were chosen if considered to be 
predictive of response status and were nonmissing for both transcript respondents and 
nonrespondents. Variables used in the nonresponse adjustment models for NPSAS were also 
included. Candidate predictor variables included a subset of the variables that were used for the 
interview weight (see section 6.1.1): 

institution control; 
region; 
institution enrollment from IPEDS file (categorical); 

• 
• 
• 
•  Pell Grant receipt (yes/no); 
•  Pell Grant amount (categorical); 
•  Stafford Loan receipt (yes/no); 
•  Stafford Loan amount (categorical); 
•  PLUS amount (categorical); 
• 
federal aid receipt (yes/no); 
• 
institution aid receipt (yes/no); 
• 
state aid receipt (yes/no); and 
•  any aid receipt (yes/no). 
Variables initially included in the nonresponse modeling included all of the candidate 

predictor variables as well as certain important interaction terms identified using CHAID. CHAID 
was run for up to three segments, resulting in the identification of two-way and three-way 
interactions. Variables that made up the CHAID interaction terms for the student transcript weight 
adjustment included all of the above variables except for federal aid receipt and Pell Grant amount. 
This initial model did not converge, but as many variables as possible were retained in the model. 

Table 42 shows the predictor variables used in the model to adjust the weight and the 

average weight adjustment factors resulting from these variables. The nonresponse weight 
adjustment factors have the following characteristics: 

•  minimum: 1.00; 
•  median: 1.06; and 
•  maximum: 2.27. 

                                                 
31 Only one nonresponse adjustment was done for the transcript weight as opposed to two for the interview weight.

Chapter 6. Weighting and Variance Estimation 

To ensure population coverage and consistency with the B&B:08/09 interview weight, the 

NPSAS:08 weight, and IPEDS, the B&B:08/09 transcript weight was adjusted to control totals 
determined by the B&B:08/09 interview weight sums. Cases which were deceased were not included 
in either the control totals or in the cases included in the adjustment. This adjustment was also 
implemented using the SUDAAN WTADJUST procedure. Variables used to define the control 
totals were the same as those used for the poststratification coverage adjustments for the 
B&B:08/09 interview weight, which are listed in section 6.1.1. The control totals for the B&B:08/09 
transcript weights were established by the weighted sums from the B&B:08/09 interview weights.   

As part of the calibration process, students with extreme (outlier) weights had different 

bounds on their adjustment factors to accomplish weight trimming and smoothing in the same step 
as calibration. Extreme weights were identified as weights greater than the median weight + 3 times 
the interquartile range or less than the median weight - 3 times the interquartile range. Weight values 
outside of these bounds were trimmed to the bounds. 

Table 43 gives the variables used for the calibration, the values of the control totals, and the 
average weight adjustment factors for each variable. Statistics for the weight adjustment factors are 
the following: 

•  Minimum: 0.08; 
•  Median: 1.52; and 
•  Maximum: 9.45. 

The response adjusted, calibrated transcript weight is the variable WTB000 on the data file.

To assess the overall predictive ability of the nonresponse model, an ROC curve was again 
used to provide a measure of how well the model correctly classified individuals of known response 
type. The plot of the first probability against the second (that is, the proportion of respondents with 
a predicted probability of response greater than c versus the proportion of nonrespondents with a 
predicted probability of response greater than c) for c ranging from 0 to 1, resulted in the ROC 
curve shown in figure 20. The area under the ROC curve is 0.67, such that 67 percent of the time 
(or almost 7 of 10 pairings), the predicted probabilities give the correct classification. The ROC area 
of 0.67 equals the value of the Wilcoxon test statistic; based on this result we reject the null 
hypothesis of no predictive ability (p < 0.05). This level of discrimination implies that the variables 
used in the model are highly informative but not definite predictors of a sample student’s transcript 
response propensity.

6.1.3  Analysis Weight for Cases With Both Student Interview and Transcript Data 

A weight was also constructed for analyzing the cases with both student interview and 

transcript data. Of the 17,070 students who were eligible for both the interview and transcripts,32 10 
were deceased, 14,010 had both a student interview and a transcript from the NPSAS school, and 
the remaining 3,040 were considered nonrespondents for this weight.  

As with the weights described in sections 6.1.1 and 6.1.2, the base weight was formed as the 
product of the first seven of the NPSAS:08 weight adjustment factors. An adjustment was made for 
nonresponse using a model-based constrained logistic weighting procedure, then the weights were 
calibrated to the sums of the B&B:08/09 interview weights for eligible cases. The procedure 
WTADJUST in SUDAAN was used to implement the nonresponse and calibration adjustments.  
The first adjustment was for nonresponse, that is, not having interview or transcript data.33 
The adjustment model included the 17,060 eligible cases who were not deceased, with the response 
indicator set to 1 for the 14,010 cases with transcript data and set to 0 for the 3,040 cases who were 
nondeceased interview and transcript nonrespondents. Predictor variables were chosen if considered 
                                                 
32 The number of students eligible for both the interview and transcripts differs from the number of students eligible for the interview 
or the transcripts due to perturbation (see section 5.5).  
33 Only one nonresponse adjustment was done for the combined interview and transcript weight as opposed to two for the interview

to be predictive of response status and were nonmissing for both interview and transcript 
respondents and nonrespondents. Variables used in the nonresponse adjustment models for NPSAS 
were also included. Candidate predictor variables included the same set of variables that was used 
for the interview weight (see section 6.1.1). 

Variables initially included in the nonresponse modeling included all of the candidate 

predictor variables as well as certain important interaction terms identified using CHAID. CHAID 
was run for up to three segments, resulting in the identification of two-way and three-way 
interactions. Variables that made up the CHAID interaction terms for the combined student 
interview and transcript weight adjustment were NPSAS response status, number of times an 
answering machine was encountered, whether the student was in a field cluster area, and counts of 
phone numbers and e-mail addresses we have for a student. This initial model did not converge, but 
as many variables as possible were retained in the model. 

Table 45 shows the predictor variables used in the model to adjust the weight and the 

average weight adjustment factors resulting from these variables. The nonresponse weight 
adjustment factors have the following characteristics: 

•  minimum: 1.01; 
•  median: 1.14; and 
•  maximum: 5.18.

B&B:08/09 Full-scale Methodology Report 

Chapter 6. Weighting and Variance Estimation 

To ensure population coverage and consistency with the B&B:08/09 interview weight, the 

NPSAS:08 weight and IPEDS, the B&B:08/09 combined interview and transcript weight was 
adjusted to control totals determined by the B&B:08/09 interview weight sums. Cases which were 
deceased were not included in either the control totals or in the cases included in the adjustment. 
This adjustment was also implemented using the SUDAAN WTADJUST procedure. Variables used 
to define the control totals were the same as those used for the poststratification coverage 
adjustments for the B&B:08/09 interview weight, which are listed in section 6.1.1. The control totals 
for the B&B:08/09 transcript weights were established by the weighted sums from the B&B:08/09 
interview weights.   

As part of the calibration process, students with extreme (outlier) weights had different 

bounds on their adjustment factors to accomplish weight trimming and smoothing in the same step 
as calibration. Extreme weights were identified as weights greater than the median weight + 3 times 
the interquartile range or less than the median weight - 3 times the interquartile range. Weight values 
outside of these bounds were trimmed to the bounds. 

Table 46 gives the variables used for the calibration, the values of the control totals, and the 
average weight adjustment factors for each variable. Statistics for the weight adjustment factors are 
the following: 

•  Minimum: 0.05; 
•  Median: 1.55; and 
•  Maximum: 7.67. 

The response adjusted, calibrated combined interview and transcript weight is the variable WTC000 
on the data file.

To assess the overall predictive ability of the nonresponse model, an ROC curve was again 
used to provide a measure of how well the model correctly classified individuals of known response 
type. The plot of the first probability against the second (that is, the proportion of respondents with 
a predicted probability of response greater than c versus the proportion of nonrespondents with a 
predicted probability of response greater than c) for c ranging from 0 to 1, resulted in the ROC 
curve shown in figure 21. The area under the ROC curve is 0.65, such that 65 percent of the time 
(or more than 6 of 10 pairings), the predicted probabilities give the correct classification. The ROC 
area of 0.65 equals the value of the Wilcoxon test statistic; based on this result we reject the null 
hypothesis of no predictive ability (p < 0.05). This level of discrimination implies that the variables 
used in the model are highly informative but not definite predictors of a sample student’s response 
propensity.

6.2  Variance Estimation 

For probability-based sample surveys, most estimates are nonlinear statistics. For example, a 

mean or proportion, which is expressed as  

m

=

xw
i

i

yw
i

i

 

∑
∑

i

i

is nonlinear because the denominator is a survey estimate of the (unknown) population total. In this 
situation, the variances of the estimates cannot be expressed in closed form. Two procedures for 
estimating variances of survey statistics are the Taylor series linearization procedure and the 
bootstrap replication procedure. Variables to use for both of these variance estimation procedures 
are available on the B&B:08/09 data files. The analysis strata and replicates created for the Taylor 
series procedure are discussed in section 6.2.1, and section 6.2.2 discusses the replicate weights 
created for the bootstrap procedure. 

6.2.1  Taylor Series 

The Taylor series variance estimation procedure is a well-known technique used to estimate 
the variances of nonlinear statistics. The procedure takes the first-order Taylor series approximation 

110 

B&B:08/09 Full-scale Methodology Report 

Chapter 6. Weighting and Variance Estimation 

of the nonlinear statistic and then substitutes the linear representation into the appropriate variance 
formula based on the sample design. Woodruff (1971) presented the mathematical formulation of 
this procedure. 

For stratified multistage surveys, the Taylor series procedure requires variance estimation 
strata and variance estimation PSUs, also called replicates, defined from the sampling strata and 
PSUs used in the first stage of sampling. Because B&B:08/09 is a follow-up study of NPSAS:08, the 
variance estimation strata and PSUs for B&B:08/09 were derived from the variance estimation strata 
and PSUs that were developed for NPSAS:08. The steps in the construction of the NPSAS:08 
stratum and PSU variables are described in chapter 6 of the NPSAS:08 Full-scale Methodology 
Report (Cominole et al. 2010). 

The variance estimation formulas require at least two PSUs in each stratum. The NPSAS:08 
variance estimation strata and PSUs were examined for the B&B:08/09 sample, and strata with only 
one PSU were combined with other strata to obtain at least two PSUs. The following three rules 
were used: variance estimation strata were combined with other variance estimation strata within the 
original NPSAS:08 sampling strata, certainty schools were combined with other certainty schools, 
and noncertainty schools were combined with other noncertainty schools. In addition, the original 
sort order that was used for constructing the NPSAS:08 variance estimation strata and PSUs was 
used. If the stratum was the first in the sorted list, then it was combined with the next stratum in the 
list. The single PSU then became an additional PSU in the new variance estimation stratum. The 
resulting variance estimation strata and PSUs for B&B:08/09 are the variables ANALSTR and 
ANALPSU. Note that these strata and PSUs were formed such that they are applicable to use with 
any of the three analysis weights described in section 6.1.  

The procedure described above may overestimate the variance because it does not always 
account for the finite population correction (FPC) at the institution stage of sampling. The Taylor 
series procedure can account for the FPC if the secondary sampling units (SSUs) and PSU counts 
are considered in addition to the analysis strata and analysis PSUs. An alternate variance estimation 
method using replicate weights to account for the FPC is also provided for users of the B&B:08/09 
data, as described below. 

6.2.2  Bootstrap Replicate Weights 

The variance estimation strategy that was chosen for B&B:08/09 is the same as that used for 

NPSAS:08 and satisfies the following requirements: 

• 
• 
• 
• 

• 

recognition of variance reduction due to stratification at all stages of sampling; 
recognition of effects of unequal weighting; 
recognition of possible increased variance due to sample clustering; 
recognition of effects of weight adjustments for nonresponse and for calibration of 
selected total estimates to known external totals or weight sums; 
satisfactory properties for estimating variances of nonlinear statistics and quantiles (such 
as the median) as well as for linear statistics; 

•  ability to apply finite population corrections at the institution stage of sampling and 

reflect the reduction in variance due to the high sampling rates in some first-stage 
sampling strata; and 

B&B:08/09 Full-scale Methodology Report 

111 

Chapter 6. Weighting and Variance Estimation 

•  ability to test hypotheses about students based on normal distribution theory by ignoring 

the finite population corrections at the student level of sampling. 

The Flyer-Kott methodology was used to develop a vector of bootstrap sample weights that 
was added to the analysis file. These weights are zero for units not selected in a particular bootstrap 
sample; weights for other units are inflated for the bootstrap subsampling. The initial analytic 
weights for the complete sample are also included for the purposes of computing the desired 
estimates. The vector of replicate weights allows for computing additional estimates for the sole 
purpose of estimating a variance. Assuming B sets of replicate weights, the variance of any estimate, 
θˆ, can be estimated by replicating the estimation procedure for each replicate and computing a 
simple variance of the replicate estimates, as follows: 

2

−

B
)ˆ
ˆ(
*
b∑
θθ
b
1
=
B

, 

var(

)ˆ
θ

=

where  *ˆbθ is the estimate based on the b-th replicate weight and B is the total number of sets of 
replicate weights. Once the replicate weights are provided, this estimate can be produced by most 
survey software packages (e.g., SUDAAN [RTI International 2008] computes this estimate by 
invoking the DESIGN=BRR option). 

The number of replicate weights was set at 200 for NPSAS:08 based on work that showed 

that this number of replicates has desirable properties for variance estimation in regression analyses. 
For the 200 replicate weights included on the weights file, both the nonresponse adjustment and 
calibration process were repeated so that the variance of survey estimates would include the 
variability due to the weight adjustments. For some of the replicates, not all of the control totals 
could be met because of model convergence problems, i.e. there was no solution to satisfy all model 
equations simultaneously. The analysis and replicate weights that are available on the weights file for 
B&B:08/09 are the following:

6.3  Overall Weighted and Unweighted Response Rates 

The overall B&B:08/09 response rate is an estimate of the proportion of the study 

population directly represented by the respondents. Because the B&B:08/09 study includes a 
subsample of NPSAS:08 nonrespondents, the overall B&B:08/09 response rate is the product of the 
NPSAS:08 institution-level response rate times the B&B:08/09 student-level response rate. 
Therefore, the overall B&B:08/09 response rates can only be estimated directly for defined 
institution characteristics.  

Table 48 gives the unweighted and weighted NPSAS:08 base-year institution and 

B&B:08/09 student response rate components by institution control. Only the weighted response 
rates can be interpreted as estimates of the proportion of the B&B:08/09 population that is directly 
represented by the respondents. The types of student respondents included in table 48 are the 
following:

The institution-level response rates shown in table 42 are the percentage of institutions that 
provided sufficient data to select the NPSAS:08 student-level sample; these rates are presented and 
discussed in the NPSAS:08 Full-scale Methodology Report (Cominole et al. 2010, table 9, p.50).  

Table 48 shows that approximately 78 percent of the eligible sample responded to the 

B&B:08/09 interview. The rate varied from 70 percent to 79 percent, by type of institution. The 
overall weighted response rate, incorporating the NPSAS:08 base-year institution response rate, was 
71 percent. The interview analysis weight described in section 6.1.1 (WTA000) was developed to 
compensate for the potentially biasing effects of interview nonresponse. 

B&B:08/09 Full-scale Methodology Report

Chapter 6. Weighting and Variance Estimation 

Table 48 also provides weighted response rates for the transcript data collection component. 

Overall, a transcript was collected from 92 percent of the eligible students. This varied, by type of 
institution, from 90 percent to 96 percent. An analysis weight (the weight variable WTB000) was 
developed for analyzing students with transcript data.  

Overall, 73 percent of the sample were respondents to both the interview and the transcript 

data collection. This rate varied, by type of institution, from 68 percent to 74 percent. The weight 
variable WTC000 was developed for analyzing students with both interview and transcript data. 

Section 6.4.2 analyzes the potential bias due to unit nonresponse and the effect the weight 

adjustments had in reducing the bias. 

6.4  Accuracy of Estimates 

The accuracy of survey statistics is affected by both random and nonrandom errors. Random 
errors reduce the precision of survey estimates, while nonrandom errors result in bias (i.e., estimates 
that do not converge to the true population parameter as the sample size increases without limit).  

The sources of error in a survey are often dichotomized as sampling and nonsampling 
errors. Sampling error refers to the error that occurs because the survey is based on a sample of 
population members rather than the entire population. All other types of errors are nonsampling errors, 
including survey nonresponse (because of inability to contact sampling members, their refusal to 
participate in the study, etc.) and measurement errors, such as the errors that occur because the 
intent of survey questions was not clear to the respondent, because the respondent had insufficient 
knowledge to answer correctly, or because the data were not captured correctly (e.g., because of 
recording, editing, or data entry errors). 

The sampling errors are primarily random errors for well-designed surveys such as 

NPSAS:08 and B&B:08/09. However, nonrandom errors can occur if the sampling frame does not 
provide complete coverage of the target population. The B&B:08/09 survey instrument and data 
collection procedures were subjected to thorough development and testing to minimize 
nonsampling errors, because these errors are difficult to quantify and are likely to be nonrandom 
errors. 

In this section sampling errors and design effects for some B&B:08/09 estimates are 

presented for a variety of domains; these sampling errors and design effects are computed using the 
analysis weights that were constructed for analyzing the B&B:08/09 student and transcript data. 

Next, the results of analyses comparing B&B:08/09 nonrespondents and respondents using 

characteristics known for both nonrespondents and respondents are presented. An analysis of 
nonresponse bias is presented at both the student level and the item level. 

6.4.1  Measures of Precision: Standard Errors and Design Effects 

The survey design effect for a statistic is defined as the ratio of the design-based variance 
estimate divided by the variance estimate that would have been obtained from a simple random 
sample of the same size. The design effect is often used to measure the effects that sample design 
features have on the precision of survey estimates. For example, stratification tends to decrease the 
variance, but multistage sampling and unequal sampling rates usually increase the variance. Weight 
adjustments for nonresponse (performed to reduce nonresponse bias) and calibration often increase 
the variance because they can increase the weight variation. Because of these factors, estimates from 

114 

B&B:08/09 Full-scale Methodology Report 

Chapter 6. Weighting and Variance Estimation 

most complex multistage sampling designs such as B&B:08/09 have design effects greater than 1.0. 
That is, the design-based variance is larger than the simple random sample variance. 

Specifically, the survey design effect for a given estimate,  ˆθ , is defined as 

Deff

ˆ(θ)

The square root of the design effect can also be expressed as the ratio of the standard errors, or 

Deft

ˆ(θ)

=

design

SE
SE

srs

ˆ(θ)
ˆ(θ)

. 

In appendix L, design effect estimates are presented for important survey domains to 

summarize the effects of stratification, multistage sampling, unequal probabilities of selection, and 
the weight adjustments. These design effects were estimated for interview and transcript data using 
SUDAAN and the bootstrap variance estimation procedure described in section 6.2.2. If an analysis 
of B&B:08/09 data must be performed without using one of the software packages for analysis of 
complex survey data, the design effect tables in appendix L can be used to make approximate 
adjustments to the standard errors of survey statistics computed using the standard software 
packages that assume simple random sampling designs. However, one cannot be confident about 
the actual design-based standard errors without performing the analysis with one of the software 
packages specifically designed for analysis of data from complex sample surveys. 

Large design effects imply large standard errors and relatively poor precision. Small design 

effects imply small standard errors and good precision. In general terms, a design effect under 2.0 is 
low, 2.0 to 3.0 is moderate, and above 3.0 is high. Moderate and high design effects often occur in 
complex surveys such as B&B:08/09, and the design effects in appendix L are consistent with those 
in past B&B studies. Unequal weighting causes large design effects and is often as a result of 
nonresponse and poststratification adjustments. However, in B&B:08/09 (as in NPSAS:08), the 
unequal weighting is also due to the sample design, different sampling rates between institution 
strata, different sampling rates between student strata, and subsampling of the nonrespondents that 
were included in B&B:08/09.  

6.4.2  Measure of Bias 

The bias in an estimated mean based on respondents,  Ry

, is the difference between this 

mean and the target parameter, π, that is, the mean that would be estimated if a complete census of 
the target population was conducted and everyone responded. This bias can be expressed as follows, 
where 

 is the expected value of the mean based on respondents over repeated samples: 

(
)RyE

) π−
. 
The estimated mean based on nonrespondents,  NRy
, can be computed if data for the 

(

particular variable are available for most of the nonrespondents. The true target parameter, π, can be 
estimated for these variables as follows:

where η is the weighted unit (or item) nonresponse rate. For the variables that are from the frame, 
rather than from the sample, π can be estimated without sampling error. The bias can then be 
estimated as follows: 

or, equivalently, 

ˆ

. 

This formula shows that the estimate of the nonresponse bias is the difference between the mean 
for respondents and nonrespondents multiplied by the weighted nonresponse rate. 

Nonresponse bias analysis was conducted when the response rate at any level (institutions, 
students, items) was below 85 percent.34 Institution nonresponse bias was performed as a part of 
NPSAS:08 and is described in the NPSAS:08 Full-scale Methodology Report (Cominole et al. 2010). 
A student nonresponse bias analysis was performed for the interview and the combined interview 
and transcript, and an item nonresponse bias analysis was also performed for both the interview and 
transcript data. The remainder of this section summarizes the unit and item nonresponse bias 
analyses that were conducted for B&B:08/09. 

Unit nonresponse bias analysis. Unit nonresponse bias analyses were conducted for the 

following sets of respondents: 

•  B&B:08/09 interview respondents versus the full set of cases eligible for B&B:08/09 

(interview respondents and interview nonrespondents), before and after the weight 
adjustment that resulted in the B&B:08/09 interview weight (WTA000); 

•  B&B:08/09 interview respondents versus B&B:08/09 interview nonrespondents, before 

• 

• 

the weight adjustment that resulted in the B&B:08/09 interview weight (WTA000); 
Interview and transcript respondents versus the full set of cases eligible for B&B:08/09 
(interview and transcript respondents and interview and transcript nonrespondents), 
before and after the combined interview and transcript weight adjustment that resulted 
in the B&B:08/09 student transcript weight WTC000; and 
Interview and transcript respondents versus interview and transcript nonrespondents, 
before the combined interview and transcript weight adjustment that resulted in the 
B&B:08/09 student transcript weight WTC000. 

The NCES Statistical Standards (NCES 2003) requires a bias analysis for any stage of a sample 

with a response rate less than 85 percent. From table 48, the weighted B&B:08/09 transcript 
response rate was greater than 85 percent overall and by control. Therefore, a unit-level 
nonresponse bias analysis was not necessary for transcripts. 

Tables in appendix M give the bias estimates as a result of the analyses listed above. The 

nonresponse bias was estimated for variables obtained from the sampling frame and from the 
NPSAS:08 data collection that are known for both respondents and nonrespondents. In all of the 
tables, the bias was estimated as follows. First, the percentage distribution was obtained for the 
respondents using the weight before and after weight adjustments. Next, the percentage distribution

Statistics 2003) for a discussion of nonresponse bias analysis.

B&B:08/09 Full-scale Methodology Report 

Chapter 6. Weighting and Variance Estimation 

was obtained for the overall sample using the B&B:08/09 base weight (described above). Then, the 
bias was estimated as the difference in the percentages. Statistical tests of the bias were also 
computed using Taylor series estimates of the standard errors, and the tables in appendix M indicate 
when the bias is statistically different from zero. 

It is also informative to compare the distributions of the respondents and nonrespondents 

before weight adjustments, and the tables in appendix M include columns that give the weighted 
distributions of respondents and nonrespondents. From the above formulas, the bias prior to the 
weight adjustment can also be obtained as the nonresponse rate multiplied by the difference 
between respondents and nonrespondents. When the bias before the weight adjustment is 
statistically significant, the differences between the respondent and nonrespondent distributions are 
almost always statistically significant. Similarly, when the differences between the respondent and 
nonrespondent distributions are statistically significant, the bias is also statistically significant. When 
one is statistically significant but not the other, the p-values are very close to 0.05. The p-values are 
not identical because of the sampling error associated with the nonresponse rate. The results of the 
statistical tests are provided in appendix M for comparing the respondent and nonrespondent 
percentages.

The variables that were used in the analyses for all sample members are the following: 
• 
• 
• 
•  Pell Grant receipt (yes/no); 
•  Stafford Loan receipt (yes/no); 
• 
• 
• 
•  any aid receipt (yes/no). 

federal aid receipt (yes/no); 
institution aid receipt (yes/no);

The variables that were used in the analyses for sample members who were federally aided during 
NPSAS:08 are the following: 

•  Pell Grant amount (categorical); 
•  Stafford Loan amount (categorical); and 
•  PLUS amount (categorical). 
The nonresponse bias was estimated for the above variables and tested to determine if the 
bias was significant at the 5 percent level. The tests are reported to be statistically significant if the 
p value is less than .05. Relative bias was also estimated and computed as the bias divided by the 
estimate of the full sample. Results are given in appendix M for all institutions combined and by 
institution control. 

Table 49 summarizes the results of the bias analysis for interview respondents before and 

after weight adjustments overall and by institution control. From table 48, the weighted B&B:08/09 

B&B:08/09 Full-scale Methodology Report

Chapter 6. Weighting and Variance Estimation 

interview response rate was less than 85 percent overall and for each of the three institution 
controls. This summary shows the estimated relative bias prior to the weight adjustment using the 
B&B:08/09 base weight or, equivalently, compared the B&B:08/09 interview respondents and 
interview nonrespondents. The summary also shows the estimated relative bias after the weight 
adjustments using the B&B:08/09 interview weight WTA000 or, equivalently, compared the 
B&B:08/09 interview respondents and the full sample. Tables in appendix M provide the detailed 
bias estimates for the interview bias analyses.  

As shown in table 49, some significant bias remains after the student interview weight 
adjustments. Significant bias was reduced after the nonresponse weighting adjustments for the 
variables known for respondents and nonrespondents. However, the calibration adjustment to 
IPEDS and NPSAS:08 totals caused some significant bias to reappear. The calibration was necessary 
to match the baccalaureate counts in B&B:08/09 to known IPEDS counts and NPSAS:08 weighted 
estimates of federal aid receipt and to get the B&B:08/09 weights and estimates more in line with 
the NPSAS:08 weights and estimates for the B&B:08/09 students.

Item nonresponse bias analysis. When item response rates were less than 85 percent, the 

NCES Statistical Standards required that a nonresponse bias analysis be conducted. This analysis 
was conducted on the data items collected in the B&B:08/09 interview based on interview 
respondents and for variables derived from student transcript data collection. As shown in the 
equation below, item response rates (RRI) are calculated as the ratio of the number of respondents 
for whom an in-scope response was obtained (Ix for item x) to the number of respondents who are 
asked to answer that item. The number asked to answer an item is the number of unit-level 
respondents (I) minus the number of respondents with a valid skip for item x (Vx). When an 
abbreviated questionnaire is used to convert refusals, the eliminated questions are treated as item 
nonresponse (NCES 2003):

. 

Item response rates were computed using nonimputed data. Valid skips were later logically 
imputed to the follow-up items after the gate question was imputed (but these imputed skips count 
as missing for computing the response rate). Table J-1 in appendix J lists the items from the 
B&B:08/09 interview along with the number of cases who were eligible to answer each item, and 
the weighted item response rates and nonresponse rates. The B&B:08/09 interview weight 
(WTA000) was used to calculate the response rates. The nonresponse rate was also the same as the 
percentage of cases for which the item was imputed. As mentioned earlier, cases who did not 
respond to a gate item were treated as missing for the items within the gate. Of the 368 items listed 
in table J-1, 149 had an item response rate less than 85 percent. 

Table J-4 lists the derived variables from the transcript data along with the number of 

eligible cases and the weighted item response rates and nonresponse rates. The B&B:08/09 student 

120 

B&B:08/09 Full-scale Methodology Report 

Chapter 6. Weighting and Variance Estimation 

transcript analysis weight (WTB000) was used to calculate the response rates. Of the 202 variables, 
all but nine had a response rate greater than 85 percent. 

A nonresponse bias analysis was conducted for items with a weighted response rate less than 

85 percent for all B&B:08/09 interview respondents, and for derived transcript variables with 
weighted response rates less than 85 percent. The possibility of estimating the degree of bias 
depends on having some variables that reflect key characteristics of respondents and for which there 
is little or no missing data. The variables that were used (from the bulleted list above) are known for 
all B&B:08/09 interview respondents. These variables are important to the study and are related to 
many of the items being analyzed for low item response rates. For the items with a weighted 
response rate less than 85 percent, the nonresponse bias prior to imputation was estimated for each 
of these characteristics that are known for respondents. 

Table M-9 in appendix M illustrates the estimated bias (prior to item imputation) for one 

item (B1ADMSUP – Teacher satisfaction: Administrative support) for B&B:08/09 interview 
respondents. Similar computations were performed and tabulations were produced for each of the 
items. Table M-10 summarizes the results of the item nonresponse bias analysis for each of the 
items from the student interview, and gives the mean and median relative bias and the percentage of 
the variable categories with statistically significant bias. Across the items, the percentage of variables 
with statistically significant bias ranged from 3 percent to 98 percent. Table M-11 gives the same 
analysis for the derived transcript items that have a weighted item response rate less than 85 percent. 

Item imputation was used to fill in missing data for B&B:08/09 interview respondents and 
nonrespondents, as described in chapter 5. Item imputation was expected to reduce the bias due to 
item nonresponse, and was used instead of a separate weight adjustment for nonresponse for each 
item. All of the questionnaire items that are listed in table J-1 were imputed using the imputation 
process described in chapter 5.  

A by-product of imputation was the reduction or elimination of item-level nonresponse bias. 

While item-level bias before imputation was measurable, after imputation it was not. As a result, 
how well an imputation procedure worked in reducing bias could not be directly evaluated. Instead, 
the before- and after-imputation item estimates were compared to determine whether the 
imputation significantly changed the biased estimates, thus suggesting a reduction in bias. Weighted 
estimates were computed using the nonimputed data (including only those cases who responded to 
the item) and also using the imputed data (including cases who responded to the item and also cases 
with imputed data for the item). Table J-2 gives the means before and after imputation for the 
continuous variables, and table J-3 gives the distributions before and after imputation for the 
categorical variables. These tables also give the difference between the preimputation and 
postimputation estimates. The difference between the pre-and postimputation estimates was 
statistically significant for 13 percent of the variables and variable categories (see table M-10). This 
suggests that imputation was only slightly successful in reducing the bias due to item nonresponse. 

Imputation was not performed for the items obtained from student transcript data. A 

weight, adjusted for students without any transcript data, was computed. Most of the variables that 
were derived from the transcript data have high item response rates (table J-4).

NPSAS:08 Institution and Student Sampling Details 

To develop the mathematical foundation for the 2007–08 National Postsecondary Student 
Aid Study (NPSAS:08) institutional and student sampling design, the following notation is used to 
represent the institutional and student sampling strata: 

r = 1, 2, ..., 46 indexes the institutional strata, and 
s = 1, 2, ..., 20 indexes the student strata. 

The strata accounted for selection of institutions in the six states where there were 

representative samples. The institution measure of size (described below) accounted for student 
counts and sampling rates. 

Further define the following notation: 

j = 1, 2, ..., J(r) indexes the institutions that belong to institutional stratum r, 
Mrs(j) = number of students enrolled during the NPSAS year who belong to student 
stratum s at the j-th institution in stratum r based on the latest IPEDS data, and 
mrs = number of students to be selected from student stratum s within the r-th 
institutional stratum, referred to henceforth as student stratum rs. 

The overall population sampling rate for student stratum rs, is then given by 

where

The student sampling rates, frs, were computed based on the final sample allocation and 

IPEDS data regarding the population sizes. 

The composite measure of size for the j-th institution in stratum r will then be defined as

which is the number of students that would be selected from the j-th institution if all institutions on 
the frame were to be sampled. 

An independent sample of institutions was selected for each institutional stratum using 

Chromy's sequential probability minimum replacement (pmr) sampling algorithm to select 
institutions with probabilities proportional to their measures of size (Chromy 1979). However, 
rather than allow multiple selections of sample institutions, those institutions with expected 
frequencies of selection greater than unity (1.00) were selected with certainty, and the remainder of 
the institutional sample was selected from the remaining institutions in each stratum. This process 
made it unnecessary to select multiple second-stage samples of persons by precluding institutions

with multiple selections at the first stage of sampling. Therefore, the expected frequency of selection

and nr is the number of noncertainty selections from stratum r.  

Within each of the r institutional types, the type r sampling frame was implicitly stratified by 

sorting in a serpentine manner (see Williams and Chromy 1980) by the following variables: 

level of for-profit 2-year-or-more institutions; 

• 
•  historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) indicator; 
•  Hispanic-serving institution indicator; 
•  Carnegie classification of postsecondary institutions; 
• 

institution region (from the IPEDS IC file) with Alaska and Hawaii moved to Region 9 
with Puerto Rico; 
state and system, for a subset of states; and 
the institution measure of size. 

• 
• 
The objective of this additional, implicit stratification was to ensure proportionate 

representation of institutions across important characteristics. 

Procedures for obtaining and sampling from student lists included: 
•  processing lists on a flow basis as they were received; 
•  ensuring that each sample institution had at least ten sample students; 
• 
•  compiling a master sample file on a flow basis as sample students were selected, 

implementing quality assurance checks against the latest IPEDS data; and 

including student sampling weights. 

Student samples were selected as stratified, systematic random samples. The student 

sampling rates were fixed for each sample institution rather than the student sample sizes: 

• 

to facilitate selecting the samples on a flow basis as the student lists were received from 
sample institutions; and

Appendix A. NPSAS:08 Institution and Student Sampling Details 

•  because sampling at a fixed rate based on the overall stratum sampling rate and the 

institution probabilities of selection results in approximately equal overall probabilities of 
selection within student strata. 

Recall that the overall population sampling rate for student stratum rs is given by 

where

For the unconditional probability of selection to be a constant for all eligible students in stratum rs, 
the overall probability of selection should be the overall student sampling fraction, frs; i.e., it was 
ensured that 

(j)

or equivalently,

f = (j)

Thus, the conditional sampling rate for stratum rs, given selection of the j-th institution, becomes

f =

π

(j)

j | rs

 

However, in this case, the desired overall student sample size, ms, is achieved only in expectation 
over all possible samples. 

Achieving the desired sample sizes with equal probabilities within strata in the particular 

sample selected and simultaneously adjusting for institutional nonresponse and ineligibility requires 
that

where R denotes the set of eligible, responding institutions. If the conditional student sampling rate

it is required that

NPSAS is a multivariate survey with a p-dimensional parameter space, θ = {θj}, f = 1, ….., p, 
for which it is desired to estimate θ with θˆ  while minimizing cost (sample size) subject to a series of 
precision requirements. Consequently, optimal sampling rates can be obtained by solving the 
following nonlinear optimization problem:

baccalaureate recipient constraints), all of the required variance components and their associated 
precision constraints were developed. Subsequently, the resulting nonlinear optimization problem to 
determine the most effective sample allocation was solved using Chromy’s algorithm (Chromy 1987) 
to obtain feasible solutions to the above problem.  

The sample size for NPSAS:08 is larger than that for past NPSAS studies. The first reason 
for the increased sample size was to ensure sufficient yield for analytic purposes. The sample size 
was designed so that respondent yield would be sufficient for analyses even if actual response rates 
were lower than the targeted rates. Second, the NPSAS:08 sample was augmented to include 
representative samples of ACG and SMART Grant recipients. Third, as previously mentioned, 
NPSAS:08 includes state-representative undergraduate student samples for four types of institutions 
(public 2-year; public 4-year; private, not-for-profit 4-year; and private, for-profit, degree-granting) in 
six states. A larger overall sample size was necessary to achieve state-representative samples in 
addition to the nationally representative sample. The study was designed to ensure adequate sample 
sizes for the domains of interest.

1. Enter all or part of the school name, and its city and 
state, if known, then click "Search for School" to display 
a list of matching schools. If your school is outside the 
U.S. and its territories, select Foreign Country from the 
state list and click "Search for School." (We do not have 
schools in foreign countries in our database so we will 
then collect some additional information from you.) 
2. Click on the name of your school in the resulting list. 
Hints: Do not use abbreviations or acronyms such as 
ASU for Arizona State University. Entering a school 
name with the city and state will help to limit the number

Dear «fname»,  
Last year you participated in the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) for the U.S. 
Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). That study answered a lot of 
questions about how students pay for college. The first report from NPSAS was recently released and is 
available at http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2009166. 
We are now asking for your help again. This summer we will be contacting you to ask some follow up 
questions as part of the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B). Data collected from B&B 
will help educators, researchers, and policymakers better understand how earning a bachelor’s degree 
affects students’ lives and choices about further education and work. 
When B&B data collection begins in July, you will receive a letter in a large white envelope that will 
provide specific information about how you can participate.  The package will also include a $5 bill as a 
token of our appreciation for your participation.  The letter will explain that if you complete the 25 
minute interview on the Web by the date indicated, you will receive an additional $30 as a token of 
our appreciation.  In the meantime, we need to update our contact information for you.  
Please help us by providing your mailing address, telephone numbers, and e-mail addresses on the 
enclosed address update sheet and returning it in the enclosed postage-paid envelope.  To find out more 
about the B&B study or to update your contact information online, visit the study’s website at 
https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/bb/ and enter the Study ID number provided in this letter. 
NCES has contracted with RTI International to conduct the B&B study on its behalf.  The enclosed 
brochure provides a brief description of B&B, findings from the 2001 B&B study, and a summary of our 
strict confidentiality procedures. If you have additional questions or concerns about the study after 
reviewing this material, please call the RTI study director, Dr. Jennifer Wine, toll-free at 1-866-662-8227.  
We thank you in advance for your participation in this important study. Your cooperation is greatly 
appreciated.

obtener empleo.

grande de color blanco que le proporcionará información específica acerca de cómo puede participar. El 
sobre también incluirá un billete de $5 dólares como muestra de nuestro agradecimiento por su 
participación. La carta le explicará que si completa la entrevista de 25 minutos en el Internet hasta 
la fecha indicada, usted recibirá $30 dólares adicionales como muestra de nuestro agradecimiento.

of our appreciation for your participation. The letter will explain that if you complete the 25-minute 
interview on the Web by the date indicated, you will receive an additional $50 as a token of our 
appreciation. 
In the meantime, we need to update our contact information for you. Please help us by providing 
your mailing address, telephone number(s), and e-mail address(es) on the enclosed address update sheet 
and returning it in the enclosed postage-paid envelope. To update your information online, or to find out 
more about B&B, visit the study’s website at https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/bb/.  
NCES has contracted with RTI International to conduct B&B on its behalf. The enclosed brochure

Spanish, are well represented in the study. In order to accomplish this goal, we have created a Spanish 
version of the interview which takes about 10 minutes to complete. 
To complete the Spanish interview online, log on to our secure website at https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/bb/ 
using the Study ID and password provided below. To complete the interview by telephone with a 
professional interviewer, please call the B&B Help Desk at 1-877-262-4440.

National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Request Letter 

<date> 

Dear Institutional Research Staff, Registrars and Officials: 
«entity_name» has been selected to participate in the 2009 Postsecondary Education Transcript Study 
(PETS:09). This study is designed to collect transcript data for students participating in two longitudinal 
studies being conducted for the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), U.S. Department of 
Education 

•  The 2008/09 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:08/09); and 
•  The 2004/09 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:04/09). 

The B&B:08/09 study collects information on recent baccalaureate recipients’ education and employment 
following award of their bachelor’s degrees. Students sampled for B&B:08/09 were first selected for 
participation as part of the 2007-08 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:08).  The 
BPS:04/09 study collects information on students’ postsecondary experiences, work while enrolled, 
persistence in school, degree completion, and employment following enrollment. Sampled students for 
the BPS:04/09 study were selected from NPSAS:04.   
As part of these studies, NCES is requesting undergraduate transcripts for B&B:08/09 and BPS:04/09 
sample members who have attended your institution.  As the BPS:04/09 study concludes, there may be 
additional sample members who report attending your institution; therefore, we may contact you again in 
about a year.  Many secure options are available to you for providing transcript data.  These options and 
instructions are included in this package. 
Linking student transcript data, interview data and other administrative record information will result in a 
dataset that researchers can use to better understand the relationship between students’ undergraduate 
education and their subsequent career paths and graduate/professional study.  NCES publications from 
previous B&B and BPS studies are available at http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/b&b/ and 
http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/bps/, respectively. 
Transcript data will be collected under the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act 
(FERPA) that allow the release of student records to the Secretary of Education or his/her agent without 
prior written consent from students. The purposes of the study and the manner in which the transcript data 
will be acquired comply fully with FERPA requirements.  We have included in this package the relevant 
passages of the legislation that authorize the transcript data collection. 
Let me assure you that very stringent measures are in place to safeguard the confidentiality of participants 
(see enclosed “Disclosure Notice”).   
NCES has contracted with RTI International (RTI) to conduct B&B:08/09 and BPS:04/09.  Your 
cooperation with RTI in these important studies is greatly appreciated.  For further information or 
questions, please contact the RTI project director, Dr. Jennifer Wine, at (919) 541-6870 or 
jennifer@rti.org. You may also contact NCES Project Officers: Ted Socha at (202) 502-7383 for 
B&B:08/09 or Dr. Tracy Hunt-White at (202) 502-7438 for BPS:04/09.

Dear {contact_salute} {contact_lname}: 
 
We greatly appreciate your cooperation in the 2009 Postsecondary Education Transcript Study. As Tom Weko, 
Associate Commissioner for the Postsecondary Studies Division of the National Center for Education Statistics, 
indicates in the enclosed letter, this study is designed to collect transcript data for the following students: 

•  Recent baccalaureate recipients sampled for the 2008/09 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study 

 

(B&B:08/09); and 

•  Students sampled for the 2004/09 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:04/09).  

 
Authorized by federal law (P.L. 103-382), the B&B:08/09 data will provide researchers, educators, and 
policymakers with critical information about the role that an undergraduate education plays in the short- and long-
term outcomes of bachelor’s degree recipients, while the BPS:04/09 data will help them better understand what 
percentage of beginning students complete their degree programs; the financial, family, and school related factors 
that prevent students from completing their programs; and what can be done to help students complete their 
schooling.   
 
I am writing to request transcripts for {sch_num} sample member{s} who attended your institution.  To facilitate 
our coding of your institution’s transcripts, it would be helpful to also receive a mapping of your institution’s degree 
programs and courses to the Classification of Instructional Programs, if such a mapping exists. Included with this 
package are detailed instructions for preparing and transmitting transcript data to RTI.  A list of students for whom 
transcripts are requested is posted, with their student ID numbers and dates of birth, at the secure study website 
listed in the box below.  To gain access to the site, you will need to log in using the username and password printed 
at the bottom of this letter.  Also available at the website are instructions for obtaining reimbursement for the 
requested transcripts, should your institution require it. We would appreciate receiving the requested transcript data 
on or before {DUE DATE}.  Please do not hesitate to call me if you feel you need to have a later delivery date. 
 
Thank you in advance for your timely participation in this important effort.  Please feel free to contact me for 
additional information.  You can reach me by telephone at (919) 541-6870 or e-mail at jennifer@rti.org. 
 
Sincerely,  
 
 
 
Jennifer Wine, Ph.D. 
B&B:08/09 and BPS:04/09 Project Director

3 Transmit Transcript Data 

A number of options are available for transmitting transcript data to RTI. Each is described below. 

Uploading to the Secure Study Website: Uploading electronic transcript data directly to the 
secure website, preferably in XML or EDI format that conforms to the PESC standard, is the 
preferred method for sending transcript data. If your transcript data are not in one of these 
formats, we ask that you or a programmer from your institution convert them to a format that we 
can process using the file specifications available from the link entitled "Upload transcript data in 
CSV or fixed-width format" on the Transcript Data Transmission page available from the Main 
Menu. However, if you are unable to reformat the transcript data to match the file specifications, 
we will accept them in their existing electronic format. NOTE: The XML formatted transcript 
should adhere to the PESC XML standard format for college transcript, version 1.0.0. The EDI 
formatted transcript should adhere to the PESC EDI standard format for Student Educational 
Record (Transcript). 
Sending Transcript Data as an Encrypted Attachment by Electronic Mail: If you choose to 
use electronic mail (e-mail) to submit student transcript data, the attachment containing the data 
will need to be encrypted, using software such as SecureZIP (select the option Use FIPS 140 
Mode), to ensure they are transmitted securely. SecureZIP can be downloaded free of charge 

B&B:08/09 Full-scale Methodology Report 

H-11 

Appendix H. Notification Material for Transcript Data Collection 

from the website: http://www.securezip.com. Detailed instructions for downloading and using 
SecureZIP can be accessed from the link "E-mail transcript data as an encrypted attachment." If 
you choose to use encryption software other than SecureZIP, please contact the Help Desk to 
ensure that the software complies with our security standards.  

Once the attachment is encrypted, send to pets@rti.org and include the file names and 
descriptions. If you need assistance with this process, please contact the Help Desk toll-free at 1-
877-256-8029 or via e-mail at pets@rti.org. 
Sending Transcript Data by Secure File Transfer Protocol (sFTP): If you choose to submit 
transcript data using the sFTP site, please contact the Help Desk to obtain the sFTP site location 
and your username and password. The Help Desk may be reached toll-free at 1-877-256-8029 or 
via e-mail at pets@rti.org. Additional instructions on how to perform the data transfer via sFTP 
may be accessed from the link "Send transcript data by secure File Transfer Protocol (sFTP)." 
After you have successfully uploaded your files to the sFTP server, please send an e-mail to 
pets@rti.org with the names of the files and their structure. 
Sending Transcript Data via eSCRIP-SAFE™: If you are a registered eSCRIP-SAFE™ sender 
and wish to use eSCRIP-SAFE™ to send your transcripts, please select RTI International, U.S. 
Department of Education Longitudinal Studies as the transcript recipient.              
Faxing Hard Copy Transcripts: If your institution is unable to provide the transcript data 
electronically via any of the methods previously mentioned, you may fax transcripts to our secure 
fax machine at 1-866-354-7066. First, fax the Student Transcript Fax Test Page included in your 
institution packet, with your name, telephone number, and fax number, to ensure that the transfer 
is working correctly. We will then confirm that we successfully received the test page. The 
confirmation is typically a return fax, but in some instances it is a phone call. If you do not receive 
confirmation within 15 minutes, please contact the fax help line at 1-866-662-8174. Once you 
receive confirmation, fax the completed Student Transcript Fax Transmittal Sheet along with the 
transcripts. If you do not have the fax test page or transmittal sheet, you may print a copy from 
the link "Fax hard copy transcripts." 

Once you have sent the transcript data, click Submit on the Transcript Data Transmission page.  

4 Provide CIP Code Mappings 

Once transcript data are received, the individual courses and degree programs reported in the transcript 
data will be coded using a common classification system, the National Center for Education Statistics' 
(NCES) Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP). The mapping(s) can be transmitted to RTI by 
uploading to the secure study website or sending via e-mail to pets@rti.org. If you choose to upload the 
mappings, please select “Upload CIP code mappings” from the Main Menu.  

5 Provide Requested Course Catalogs 

If we need a course catalog from your institution, there will be a Catalog Transmittal Sheet in your packet. 
It includes a list of the catalogs requested and instructions for sending them to RTI. If you do not find a 
Catalog Transmittal Sheet in your packet, then no catalogs are needed from your institution at this time.

NOTE: The sample size column contains the number of cases who may have been eligible to respond to the item. For items that are within a 
gate question, the sample size includes cases who did not respond to the gate question. The item response rates and nonresponse rates 
were computed using the B&B:08/09 student transcript analysis weight. The response rate is computed as the number of cases who 
responded to the item and did not have a legitimate skip for the item divided by the number of cases who did not have a legitimate skip for 
the item. CIP = Classification of Instructional Programs GPA = grade point average. NPSAS = National Postsecondary Student Aid Study. 
STEM = science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.

2 DEFF is the survey design effect for a statistic and is defined as the ratio of the design-based variance estimate over the variance estimate 
that would have been obtained from a simple random sample of the same size (if that were practical). 
NOTE: Responses that include logical skips, not applicable, missing, unknown, or multiple possible answers were excluded from analysis.

have been obtained from a simple random sample of the same size (if that were practical). 
2 DEFF is the survey design effect for a statistic and is defined as the ratio of the design-based variance estimate over the variance estimate 
that would have been obtained from a simple random sample of the same size (if that were practical).

1 DEFT is the square root of DEFF and can also be defined as the ratio of the design-based standard error over the standard error that would 
have been obtained from a simple random sample of the same size (if that were practical). 
2 DEFF is the survey design effect for a statistic and is defined as the ratio of the design-based variance estimate over the variance estimate 
that would have been obtained from a simple random sample of the same size (if that were practical). 
NOTE: Responses that include logical skips, not applicable, missing, unknown, or multiple possible answers were excluded from analysis. 
NPSAS = National Postsecondary Student Aid Study. AP = advanced placement. STEM = science, technology, engineering, and

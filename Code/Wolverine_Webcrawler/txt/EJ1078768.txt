Abstract 
This article explores the future potential for the development of online courses. The findings are based on an empirical 
study with 3 sample groups: (1) B2C segment in Germany, (2) B2C segment in the United States, and (3) B2B segment 
(international).  In  the first  step  the  status quo of  the use of  e-learning  in general  and online  courses  in particular  is 
presented. Subsequently, the expectations of potential users concerning the design of online courses are determined. 
Respondents  were  segmented  according  to  their  basic  needs,  based  on  ten  distinct  attributes  relevant  for  the 
decision-making process. Thirdly, an innovative concept for online courses is reviewed as part of a concept test. Since 
people increasingly watch (short) videos instead of reading documents, the authors emphasize that creators of online 
courses  can  take  advantage  of  this  development,  provided  they  adapt  their  formats  to  the  changed  communication 
behavior of potential users. 
Keywords: e-learning, online courses, customer satisfaction, willingness to pay, innovative formats 
1. Introduction 
According to Androulla Vassiliou - European Commissioner for Education, Culture, Multilingualism and Youth - “the 
online and open education world is changing how education is resourced, delivered and taken up. Over the next 10 
years,  e-learning  is  projected  to  grow  fifteen-fold,  accounting  for  30%  of  all  educational  provision”  (European 
Commission, 2014). Among the instruments of e-learning, online courses are regarded as a subsector with particularly 
strong growth. The dream of the “democratization of knowledge” might soon be fulfilled: as stated by Fozdar (2015), 
ODL (Open and Distance Learning) may be the solution for overcoming the gap between those who have had access to 
science and technology education and those who have not.   
“Massive Open Online Courses” (MOOCs) represent an important step in this direction. These are online courses with 
scientific content and a large number of participants – in some cases tens of thousands. A typical online course includes 
digital lectures with interactive elements such as discussions in forums and multiple-choice questions. Enrollment to the 
course is usually free, or very cheap. By December 2014 the number of universities offering MOOCs has exceeded 400, 
and the cumulative number of courses offered has reached 2,400. Courses are often financed by venture capital firms, 
nonprofit  organizations,  profit  oriented  companies,  and  universities  (Holdaway,  2015).  Alsadhan,  Alhomod  &  Shaf 
(2014) express themselves less euphoric about the future potential of online courses when stating that “there is a little 
doubt that e-learning courses are becoming more popular each day with thousands of students joining the new courses 
each day. A survey of online courses reveals that most of the courses are mostly text-based.” Also, growing interest in 
video  format  can  be  recognized  with  regard  to  the  development  of  YouTube  video  hosting.  The  average  upload  of 
videos to YouTube per minute, boosted from 8 hours in 2007 to 300 hours in 2014 (Statista, 2014). 
1.1 Broad Application of Online Courses 
In addition to the academic field, today e-learning plays a significant role in other areas. It offers the prospect of a 
substantial scalability that is not limited to the classical school or university environment (teacher in a classroom). The 
scalability in turn includes the opportunity to offer online courses on various topics to a broad range of the population at

a  relatively  low  price  or  even  for  free.  During  the  last  3  years  “…  MOOCs  have  largely  moved  from  pedagogy  to 
promotion and are now more used to advance institutional reputation than any serious drive to reinvent the institution” 
(Stewart, Khare & Schatz, 2015).   
However, if online courses are also of interest for a wider range of segments (B2C or B2B) and offer a significant value 
proposition,  they  do not necessarily  have  to be  free of  charge.  Consequently, platforms  like  Udemy  offer both: free 
online courses and courses with prices of up to USD 500 (on average USD 75).1 
1.2 Study Background and Objectives 
The  Simpleshow  Company  (hereinafter  TSC)  is  a  media  company  (founded  in  2008),  which  is  specialized  in  the 
production of explanatory videos (2 – 4 minutes length) in the business sector. With an accumulated production volume 
of approximately 5,000 videos, TSC has a leading position in the worldwide market. As explanatory videos strongly 
compress information and achieve high recall values due to their unique presentation style, there are opportunities to 
use  these  advantages  as  one  of  several  key  elements  of  an  online  course.  Short  videos  (e.g.  10  minutes  length),  at 
discrete  intervals  during  the  week,  presented  to  stimulate  students,  can  be  more  effective  than  long  one  hour 
monologues (University of London, 2013). This corresponds with the finding that it is particularly common for students 
to complain about the workload on new courses (Mason and Weller, 2000), and that the length of the course plays a 
crucial role. 
The  general  objective  of  the  study  is  to  explore  the  future  prospects  of  online  courses  using  a  quantitative  and 
representative survey and to measure the acceptance of innovative online courses (concept testing). Within the global 
market of e-learning, Western Europe (16 %) and North America (53%) are key markets (Docebo, 2014). Therefore 
Germany and the U.S. were selected as focus regions. In addition to the B2C perspective, the segment of B2B contacts 
of TSC has been included in the study. In particular it is assumed that the affinity to online courses and explanatory 
videos is above average in the B2B segment. 
1.3 Research Questions 

1.  What  are  relevant  customer  segments  for  e-learning  in  general  and  online  courses  in  particular?  Which 

differences are prevalent across the sample groups? 

2.  How  were  online  courses  used  in  the  past  (customer  groups,  topics,  formats)  and  evaluated  in  terms  of 

customer satisfaction? Which areas offer opportunities for improvements? 

3.  What are the key requirements to using online courses in the future? Is there a willingness to pay for online 

courses? 

4.  How do potential users of online courses evaluate new formats of online courses (30 min, change of style, 
sequence of 3 min explanation/explanatory videos etc.)? How does the explanatory video style influence the 
overall evaluation of the online course concept? 

5.  How does product-category expertise influence the results of the concept test? Do the results differ between 

B2C and B2B respondents? 

2. Method 
2.1 Procedures and Methodology 
In order to answer the research questions, an empirical study was developed and carried out. It allows getting insights to 
regional differences in the B2C sector as well as differences between the B2B and B2C segments.   
To map the B2B segment, TSC´s contact data was provided by the company's CRM system and was used for the survey. 
As the study aims to ensure a representative description of the status quo for important target countries (B2C markets), 
the survey utilized contacts that have been made available through two online access panels. In addition to the economic 
benefits of an online research study this survey type also has further substantive advantages for concept testing. This is 
particularly true when different types of information such as videos and graphics will be presented during the interview. 
As the assessment of innovative formats of online courses is relevant for the study, online market research becomes 
particularly favorable. 
The online survey - representing 3 different groups (n=1.176) - was conducted in July 2015 and was focused on B2C as 
well as B2B segments (see Table 1). 
 
 
                                                        
1    In the meanwhile, there are indications that the commercial sector marketing faces increasing price pressure. This could explain 

why Udemy introduced an upper price limit of $ 300 in June 2015.

2.3 Data Analysis 
To examine the significance within the three sample groups and to statistically evaluate background characteristics, the 
repeated measures ANOVA, given its ability to perform overall comparisons, as well Chi-Square distribution tests were 
used. Hierarchical clustering to determine the number of clusters and K-Means-Clustering were used for segmentation. 
All analytical work was done by SPSS version 22.   
3. Results 
3.1 Experiences with e-learning and Online Courses in the Past 
As shown in Table 2, the level of involvement in e-learning reaches 45 % in the U.S., compared to 38 % in Germany. In 
contrast,  83  %  of  B2B  respondents  already  experienced  e-learning.  Differences  are  significant,  when  performing 
Chi-Square Test (p=0.001). Overall, experience with e-learning is strongly correlated with age: all sample groups have 
shown lower level of involvement if respondents are seniors (60+ years).

* Question: Do you already have experience with e-learning in general, and have you also used digital learning applications? Values in ( ): 60+ years 
Respondents who confirmed e-learning experience were asked to indicate which digital learning applications were used. 
Here, the usage of online references (for example Wikipedia) ranks number 1 (see Table 3). While blended learning 
plays a minor role in Germany, its relevance increases in the U.S. B2C and the B2B segments. Since the term "online 
course" is not clearly defined, the following definition has been used in the study: users of YouTube training videos, 
online trainings or learning applications. Overall, 75 % of the B2B contacts completed at least one online course in the 
past, followed by the B2C segment in the U.S. (34%) and the B2C segment in Germany (29%). At the same time about 
one third of all users of online courses did not complete one or more online courses. When asked for the reasons (open 
question) it turned out that length (“course was too long”, 38 % of responses) as well as style and pedagogy (32 % of 
responses) were the main factors. Among all respondents students showed the highest drop-out rate.

* Question: Which digital learning applications did you use? (Multiple responses). 
Online courses cover a broad range of topics. Here, business and professional topics play a dominant role (especially in 
the B2B segment). The relevance of language courses strongly differs between the B2C segments in the U.S. (13 %) 
and Germany (45 %).3  Similarly, the length of the courses shows a wide range.4  B2B respondents prefer rather short 
online courses (51 % up to 1 hour). Between 15 % (B2B contacts) and 22 % (B2C, Germany) of respondents paid for 
the last online course. The median price is approximately USD 90 in the B2C segments and is significantly higher in the 
B2B segment (median: USD 550). 
The degree of customer satisfaction with online course reaches 48 % (top-2) in Germany and is significantly lower in 
the U.S. (29 %), while the highest level is recorded in the B2B segment (45 %, differences are significant, p<0.000). 
                                                        
3    Other sources confirm that there is a wide gap of speaking foreign languages in the U.S. compared to Europa. The National 
Journal reports that only 10% of native-born Americans can speak a second language, compared to 56% of European Union 
citizens (Czekalinski, 2012). The MLA's newest report, released this month, highlights a drastic fallout in foreign language 
studies: roughly 100,000 fewer students took language classes in 2013 than did in 2009, the last time the association surveyed 
students (Ferdman, 2015). 

4    In order to obtain a neutral picture as possible on the use of online courses and to capture the memory of respondents as 

concretely as possible, the interview focused on the last online course conducted by the respondent. 

 

26 

Journal  of  Education  and  Training  Studies                                                                                          Vol.  4,  No.  1;  January  2016 

Therefore  it  can  be  assumed  that  there  is  considerable  room  for  improvement  in  the  market.  Concerning  potential 
drivers, the length of a course does not significantly influence customer satisfaction (p=0.055); neither do the number of 
courses booked (p=0.340), and the topic of the course (p=0.340). The customer satisfaction level is below average for 
business  topics  and  is  above  average  for  languages  and  leisure  topics.  However,  the  satisfaction  level  significantly 
depends  on  age  groups  (p=0.001).  Furthermore,  there  are  indications  that  the  style  of  the  video  and  its  format  are 
relevant factors as well. Pictures, video sequences, and text pages appear significantly more frequently in those courses 
that were rated "satisfying" by their customers. In particular respondents in the age of up to 30 years are less euphoric 
about their last online course (top-2: 29 %, low-2: 30 %). 
Since many possibilities for the distribution of online courses exist (Holdaway, 2015), further questions focused on the 
awareness and use of the most important marketing and distribution platforms. As it turned out the market for online 
courses  is  strongly  fragmented:  Khan  academy  reaches  24  %  in  terms  of  awareness  (recognition).  All  other  online 
platforms rank lower. 
3.2 Consumer Expectations and Drivers of the Decision for Online Courses 
Most respondents see online courses as a good option/opportunity to get further training in interesting subject areas. The 
evaluation of statements concerning online courses is especially positive within the B2B segment, as well as the group 
of respondents with usage of online courses in the past. 
Overall, approximately one fourth of the respondents have used online courses in the past and have indicated usage in 
the  future.  Typically,  those  interviewees  have  a  relatively  high  degree  of  customer  satisfaction  (49  %  top-2)  and 
intensively book online courses. More than 80 % of them are employed and 58 % are willing to pay for online courses. 
Concerning the B2B segment the share of this subgroup is 64 %. 
To  identify  the  decision  drivers  when  selecting  online  courses,  a  3-steps-design  was  chosen.  At  the  beginning  the 
preferred type of course was defined (language, business topics etc.). Afterwards ten decision criteria were presented. 
These  attributes  were  explained  by  incremental  changes  in  the  characteristics,  which  have  been  referred  to  as 
improvements. Respondents were asked to identify the most important feature from their point of view. Finally, they 
were  asked  to  distribute  a  total  of  100  points  according  to  the  importance  of  the  individual  attribute.  This 
3-steps-approach was developed to ensure a realistic decision-making including typical trade-offs (Netzer & Srinivasan, 
2007). The authors have successfully implemented this approach in other research fields (see Kalt, Bongaerts & Krämer, 
2013). The evaluation of the individual criteria seems to be balanced: on average weights were specified at 5.5 out of 10 
possible criteria, a clear indicator that respondents more intensively have set itself apart with the attributes shown. This 
is confirmed by the measured answer time in the interview.

* Question: Below we would like to ask you a few questions about the decision-making criteria for selecting online courses in the field of … (most 
relevant topic for the interviewee is embedded) Various improvements are shown below. First, please tell us the most important improvement for 
selecting a course. Please allocate 100 points to the improvements according to their weight. ( ) Standard  Deviation; Basis: Respondents, who 
generally consider to book online courses (n=680). 

While  “providing  a  certificate”  and  “offering  lower  prices”  rank  top  among  decision  criteria  in  the  B2C  segments, 
“reduced duration” and “high level of entertainment” are the most relevant factors in the B2B segment (Table 4). Due to 
classification  of  respondents  3  different  clusters  can  be  identified:  (1)  focus  on  a  wide  range  of  criteria  (called 
“Indifferent”), (2)  focus  on  time  and  (3) focus  on  certificate.  Provided key  customer  needs  are  met,  almost  70% of 
respondents in Germany and U.S. (B2C) indicate a willingness to pay (B2B segment: 96 %). Interviewees, who are 
already planning to book online courses in the future, show a particularly high willingness to pay for online courses. 
Strong variances of recorded values in addition to the calculated mean values can be recognized. This suggests that 
behind those mean values different subgroups can be identified respectively - each of which has a focus on specific

*  Question: Now imagine an online course consisting of several three-minute chapters. Each chapter can follow different formats such as the TSC 

video you have just seen, but also traditional elements. Would you book such an online course? (Scale from 0=not at all to 10=very probable, 
How much would you pay to participate in this online course (30 min.)? 

**  Scale points 0–7 (on the 0-10 scale) used to define low probability to book an online course as presented. 
4. Discussion 
The  study  results  show  that  the  use  of  online  courses  has  become  popular  among  the  population  and  is  not  only  a 
subject for academic training. Free of charge offers do not necessarily have a high quality. This also applies to online 
courses. On the one hand the number of users of online courses increases. On the other hand a relatively low degree of 
customer satisfaction suggests that there is a considerable room for improvement. Correspondingly, dropout rates are 
high. For 2014 Stanford University reported a completion rate of just 5 – 10 % (Walsh, 2015). This is consistent with 
the results of our study, showing an above-average proportion of not completed courses in the group of students. For 
other target groups, this is also true. Studies with focus on the business environment underline also that employees only 
weakly  participate  in  online  courses  (IBIS  Capital,  2013).  A  lack  of  incentives,  failure  to  understand  the  content 
material, having no one to turn to for help, and having other priorities to fulfill, are the main reason for drop out, as Hew 
and Cheung (2014) point out. The authors conclude, “quality of MOOC education and MOOC business model are some 
unresolved issues”. Other studies show that course completers tend to be more interested in the course content, whereas 
non-completers tend to be more interested in MOOCs as a type of learning experience (Wang & Baker, 2015). 
As described by Shah (2014), most popular subjects of online courses are IT/software-use (Java coding, Excel, Adobe), 
business (entrepreneurship, project management, investing and others), and science (Biology, Physics, Medicine). This 
does  not  contradict  the  empirical  results  presented  in  our  study.  However,  a  special  feature  is  the  importance  of 
languages as a topic for online courses in Germany. In this case, significant differences between the study regions arise. 
With  regard  to  the  requirements  of  the  potential  benefits  to  the  design  of  online  courses,  it  becomes  evident  that  a 
special sub-segment, in particular, expects a strong reduction in the length of online courses. This may be explained by 
two factors. On the one hand, shorter courses provide more options to fit the course in the time schedule. On the other 
hand, such courses are compressed in terms of content and detail. Here, videos can play a crucial role. Since video 
content is easy to understand and learners often retain more by watching a video than by reading a document (Abeer & 
Miri,  2014),  the  video  format  is  one  option  to  compress  content  in  order  to  reduce  the  length  of  an  online  course. 
Further examining the possibilities of use and the learning efficiency of explanatory videos help identifying a rule of 
thumb: shorter videos are more engaging than longer videos. It should be strived to make the content as concise as 
possible  to  achieve  the  highest  engagement.  The  longer  the  video  is,  the  higher  the  dropout  rates  (Hornung,  2014). 
However, this relationship is not linear. Usually higher dropout rates arise when thresholds are exceeded: 2-3 min, and 
10 min, respectively (Ruedlinger, 2012). 
As presented by Sun, et al. (2008) “course quality is the most important concern in this e-learning environment. Course 
content should be carefully designed and presented sparingly. Technological design plays an important role in students’ 
perceived usefulness and ease of use of a course and will have an impact on students’ satisfaction.” Taking into account 
the  low  degree  of  satisfaction  concerning  the  quality  of  online  courses  (students  and  other  target  groups)  and  an 
increasing demand for stronger compression of the content, it is consistent that the concept test shows positive results 
for an online course format, which is based on a reduction in the duration of the course and the use of different elements 
(Instructor, charts, videos, etc.). Format and design are two factors among others that determine the quality of online 
courses. Further factors, which make up the quality, are the right content and the educational concept. This is consistent 
with findings of Lister (2014), which suggest that there are four main considerations when designing e-learning and 
online courses: i) course structure, ii) content presentation, iii) collaboration and interaction, and iv) timely feedback. 
Overall,  the  study  shows  a  high  interest  in  innovative  online  courses  concept  and  good  chances  of  success.  The 
presented design is strongly focused on the inclusion of short explanatory videos. Increasingly, people do not take the 
time to read documents - they watch videos instead (Bowley, 2015). Considering this, suppliers of online courses can

also  take  advantage  of  this  development  provided  they  are  able  to  adapt  formats  to  the  changed  requirements  of 
potential users. In addition to the concept test in September 2015 a market test will start, wherein a fully developed 
online course (according to the design featured in interview) is offered on a well-known online platform.

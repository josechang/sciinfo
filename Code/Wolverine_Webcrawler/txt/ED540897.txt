Abstract 

2 

American opinion on spanking has shifted. Most Americans agreed with the necessity of 

sometimes spanking children, but proportions disagreeing increased 15 percentage point (94% 

overall) between 1986 (16%) and 2010 (31%). Growing proportions disagreed with spanking in 

each consecutive decade for all significant generational cohorts, with the greatest increase 

against spanking for Silent Generation. In a logistic regression model, Poverty Level became an 

insignificant predictor for agreement with spanking. Top predictors in the logistic regression 

model employed in the current study were South Central Region of United States (b=.835), 

African American Race (b=.795), Rural Residence Type (b=.565), Male Gender (b=.446), and 

High School Diploma or Less Educational Attainment Level (b=.422). Findings inform corporal 

punishment policies affecting thousands of students.   

 

 

 

 

Should Discipline Hurt? Shifting American Spanking Beliefs and Implications for School 

Corporal Punishment Policies 

Corporal punishment (CP) policies develop within a macro context of American spanking 

3 

beliefs (Figure 1). A central purpose of the study was to investigate American spanking beliefs 

over time. An apposite opportunity for examining spanking beliefs was presented by the survey 

prompt: “Do you strongly agree, agree, disagree, or strongly disagree that it is sometimes 

necessary to discipline a child with a good, hard, spanking?” (Smith, Marsden, Hout, & Kim, 

1972-2010). Spanking was described as an old-fashioned behavior (Gershoff, 2010), and survey 

responses were investigated by generational cohort and decade. A secondary query regarding 

associations between spanking and a rich collection of predictors was also investigated. Three 

research questions guided the investigation:  

1.  Do a majority of Americans agree it is sometimes necessary to discipline a child “with a 

good, hard, spanking” (Smith, et al., 1972-2010), and how have opinions changed over 

time? 

2.  How do American beliefs on spanking change by generational cohort and over time 

within generational cohorts?                                                                                                         

3.  What associations are evident between belief in spanking and Educational Attainment 

Level, Gender, Number of Children, Poverty Level, Race, Region of United States, and 

Residence Setting (i.e., rural, urban)? 

Literature Review 

 

Many generations-old practices and parenting techniques were antiquated by changing 

times, but physically disciplining children is a withstanding hallmark of old-fashioned American 

childrearing (Gershoff, 2010). Twenty-one states in the United States permit CP in schools, and 

4 

 

223,190 American students in 2005-2006 were subjected to spanking or paddling at school at 

least once (The Center for Effective Discipline, 2011). Eighty-five percent of American middle 

and high school students were physically disciplined by parents (Gershoff, 2010), and most 

parents report spanking their children (Gershoff, 2002; Larzelere & Baumrind, 2010; Marinescu, 

2010; Straus & Paschall, 2009). A majority of Americans agrees spanking or paddling children is 

sometimes a necessity (Lansford, Wager, Bate, Pettit, & Dodge, 2012; Marinescu, 2010; Nolen, 

2010; Strassberg, Dodge, Pettit, & Bates, 1994). 

 

American tolerance of CP in schools is at odds with 106 nations, including 19 European 

countries, banning CP (ACLU/Human Rights Watch, 2008; Nolen, 2010). The Council of 

Europe, the European Union, the United Nations, as well as 45 American organizations—

including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Council of Exceptional Children, 

and the Society for Adolescent Medicine—oppose CP of students (The Center for Effective 

Discipline, 2008). An estimated one to two percent of students disciplined with CP, 

approximately 10,000-20,000 students, will sustain injuries requiring medical treatment 

(Greydanus, et al., 2003; Poole, et al., 1991; Wasserman, 2011). Higher incarceration rates, 

lower ACT composites, and lower graduation rates are associated with states permitting CP (The 

Center for Effective Discipline, 2008a). According to Nolen (2010), detrimental effects of CP for 

the individual child include “increased crime, suicidal thoughts, individual fear, racial prejudice, 

gender bias, and child abuse” (p.526).  Straus and Paschall (2009) observed a relationship 

between the physical discipline of children and lagging cognitive ability. An association between 

spanking and increased aggression has frequently been reported (Bates, 1994; Greydanus, et al., 

2003; Hicks-Pass, 2009; Strassberg, et al., 1994). The abundance of literature against CP 

notwithstanding, the physical discipline of children is routine and broadly accepted as a method 

 

of maintaining school discipline in some American schools, particularly in the South (Nolen, 

2010).  Alternatively, a growing number of states and school districts are banning CP (Larzelere 

5 

& Baumrind, 2010).

Region of United States, and Residence Setting (i.e., rural, urban) 

Theoretical Framework 

 

A hypothesis of shifting spanking views over time was investigated (Figure 1). Individual 

spanking beliefs may depend on generation and historical times. Characterizations of spanking as 

an old-fashioned, generational practice guided observations by generational cohorts. Individual 

beliefs on spanking may also be influenced by other factors. Relationships between spanking and 

Educational Attainment Level, Gender, Number of Children, Poverty Level, Race, Region of 

United States, and Residence Setting were identified in previous literature. 

 

National, state, and district level CP policies reflect American collective conscious on 

spanking (Figure 1). American spanking beliefs have voice in discussions on the physical 

discipline of students at school. An overarching study hypothesis was American views on 

spanking have shifted. A practical assumption being, as American spanking beliefs shift, so to 

should CP policies change. Observations of CP bans in other developed countries and a trend 

towards large school districts banning CP guided comparisons over time.

tabulations, comparing means, and logistic regressions. Descriptive statistics for study variables 

and a Log Odds Ratio Matrix for variables are available in a supplemental file. To answer 

Research Question One and Research Question Two, in part, percentages, frequencies, Pearson 

Chi-Squares, significance levels, and population were reported in cross-tabulation tables for 

American spanking belief (Table 1) and spanking belief over time by generational cohort (Table 

2). A stratified cluster sample design was employed with a Taylor series approximation method. 

Samples were complex and a Rao-Scott adjustment was applied, with F statistics factored. 

Specifically, significance levels were from F statistics. An experimental survey weight 

(FORMWT) was applied to analyses. Statistics exclude missing-data and out-of-range values. To 

further answer Research Question One and Research Question Two, spanking belief means were 

charted over time (Figure 2) and by generational cohorts (Figure 2). Pearson Chi-Squares, 

significance levels, population, and range were reported in figure notations. A 95% confidence 

level was applied throughout, and a threshold of .05 determined statistical significance.    

      Logistic regressions investigated associations between agreement with spanking and 

independent predictors (Research Question Three). All variables were dichotomized. Spanking, 

the dependent variable, was dichotomized for favoring spanking (Agree and Strongly Agree). 

Predictors were dichotomized by observing category or categories with largest proportion 

agreeing with spanking or categories connected by previous literature with favoring spanking. To 

better understand and quantify effects of targeted predictors, associations between agreement 

with spanking and predictors were observed independently and in a model. To compare the 

strength of predictors, a logistic regression model was built by adding predictors in the order of 

 

strongest to weakest independent predictor. Regression coefficients /B/ were reported and 

measure one unit change effect in the independent variable on the dependent variable logit. 

Coefficients, Standard Errors, single parameter t-tests, and p values were reported in Table 3. 

The exponential of logistic regression coefficients (Exp [B]) estimated odds ratios for observing 

8 

outcomes (Table 3).

Research questions were examined with the 1972-2010 General Social Survey (GSS) Datafile 

from the National Opinion Research Center (Smith, et al., 1972-2010). The survey was accessed 

through the Computer-assisted Survey Methods Program at the University of California, 

Berkley. The GSS tracks attitudinal and other measures on non-institutionalized, English 

speaking Americans over the age of 18 (Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social 

Research [ICPSR], 2007). Spanish speaking Americans were included in the GSS target 

9 

 

population since 2006 (Smith, Marsden, Hout, & Kim, 2011). Thousands of variables are 

included in the GSS replicating core and special interest topic modules. The same spanking 

prompt was part of the replicating GSS core since 1986. Full probability sampling was utilized 

(ICPSR, 2007). Surveys 2004 and after sub-sampled non-respondents, and surveys 2006-2010 

utilized sampling based on the United States Census (ICPSR, 2007). Response rates varied 

slightly for each survey year, with a total response rate of approximately 71% (ICPSR, 2007).  

Total GSS sample size for years of the current study was 36,501. 

Research Question One 

Results 

 

Most Americans agreed or strongly agreed with spanking in 1986 and 2010 (Table 3). 

However, the proportion of Americans disagreeing or strongly disagreeing with spanking 

increased 14 percentage point (82%) overall between 1986 (17%) and 2010 (31%). The trend 

towards disagreeing with spanking is observed on Figure 2 as a rising spanking mean trend line 

between 1986 and 2010.

Research Question Two 

11 

 

A shift towards disagreement with spanking in each consecutive generation is observed 

as a rising spanking mean trend line on Figure 3. For significant cohorts, a pattern of greater 

proportions disagreeing with spanking in each generation in each consecutive decade was 

observed (Table 2). Proportions disagreeing with spanking for Lost and G.I. Generations rose seven 

percentage points or 37% overall between the 1980’s (19%) and 2000’s (26%). A 10 percent point or 

55% overall increase in the proportion of Silent Generation was evident between the 1980’s (18%) 

and 2000’s (28%). The proportion of Baby Boomers disagreeing with spanking was slightly higher 

(one-four percentage points) than that of Silent Generation in each decade. The increase in 

proportions disagreeing with spanking was similar, however, for Baby Boomers and the Silent 

Generation (10 percentage points or 53% overall)

Research Question Three 

12 

 

Predictors were added to the model from strongest to weakest independent predictor in the 

following order: Region of United States (1), Race (2), Residence Type (i.e., rural, urban) (3), 

Educational Attainment (4), Gender (5), Number of Children (6), Poverty Level (7), and 

Generational Cohorts (8). Low Poverty Level was expected to be a significant predictor, but was 

insignificant when added and removed. Four or More Children (b=.173) and Lost /G.I. 

Generational Cohorts (b=.139) were expected to be more strongly correlated, based on previous 

literature. The top five predictors for agreement with spanking revealed by analysis used in the 

current study were South Central Region of United States (b=.835), African American Race 

(b=.795), Rural Residence Type (b=.565), Male Gender (b=.446), and High School Diploma or 

Less Level of Educational Attainment (b=.422). (Table 3) 

Conclusion and Discussion 

 

Study findings support a notion of shifting belief on spanking. A glance towards 

European nations may suggest to Americans that in today’s contemporary world where some 

school environments are overburdened by the types and intensity of social ills alien to other 

generations and times, spanking may have outgrown its effectiveness. More importantly, 

educational institutions may have evolved beyond the paddle.   

 

Future research may identify factors behind the shift in spanking views. Do relationships 

exist between school environments in academic turnaround, increased CP incidences, and greater 

disagreement with spanking?  Do parents and educators have growing concerns over detrimental 

effects? Is ineffectiveness of CP a growing opinion among parents and educators? School discipline 

and CP should be specifically explored in future research. Even with awareness of correlational 

research limitations, justifying CP with maintaining discipline may be difficult if schools with higher 

incidences of CP have greater discipline and dropout problems. Effective discipline in those school 

 

districts banning CP, however, makes this point moot. Qualitative research giving voice to students 

13 

subjected to frequent paddling may prove insightful.

The dilemma of differentiating cruel and unusual punishment from acceptable punishment 

14 

has been noted (Palmer, 2010), and individual student characteristics may be determining factors. 

Without better understandings of effectiveness, populations where CP may be most harmful and least 

effective may be subjected to higher incidences of CP (i.e., students with disabilities, disadvantaged 

or at risk students).  

 

A theoretical underpinning of CP in schools appears to need clarity—is freedom from CP a 

right, and if so, at what age is it gained? Perhaps CP is a right exclusive to the educational system?  

Corporal punishment in American penal institutions has been held unconstitutional (violating Eighth 

and Fourteenth Amendments) (Palmer, 2010). Why do rights of older students, albeit all students, in 

American k-12 schools appear more diminished than the rights of prisoners? Considering the shifting 

collective conscience on spanking, school boards may have been granted too much discretion. Wide 

district to district variance for discipline consequences is out of step with a national movement 

towards common academic standards.  

Significance of the Study 

 

Findings amplify a call to inform policymakers with research on an issue with capacity 

for affecting thousands of American students. Stakeholders are more aware of undercurrents 

affecting school environments with greater understandings of shifting American spanking belief.

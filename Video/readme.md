# Introduction
This readme file contains the subheadings and sources about the video which had been done by the all participants of the Scientific Information Gathering and Processing for Engineering Research course held by Professor Nordling at the National Cheng Kung University in the spring semester of 2016.
# Subheadings
Hello everyone , I'm Paul from team RCPL. Now I am going to show you the tasks and the things we have done this year. Through this video, you can easily comprehend the things we have done this year. Let's get started!
#### User story
This is our user story, you can view it from the slide. As a researcher, I need a PDF reader, so I can click on a highlighted text. Then I can get the similar parts in decreasing order. Besides, the result should contain the title of the publication and its link to the publisher’s full text PDF, so I can find the information about any part that interests me
#### NWWC circle
As you can see from the slide, this is our NWWC circle. Because of this circle, you can know the tasks we have done in chronological order. First, we build a search bar by using Django. Then, we can get the search result based on the search query. In order to have a user-friendly web page, we add some CSS program into it! Then we extend our database to 89 articles by manually downloading them from Internet. Finally, we can display the similarity percentage and build a good-looking result page.
#### Demonstation
Now I am going to demonstrate the things we have completed this year. First, I need to connect to the server. As you can see from the web page, this is our search bar. You can try to click on the "about", it will show you the tutorial about how to use it. After input the search string, you just need to click on the "search buttom" and it will display the search results!
#### Conclusion
Here's the conclusion. We now have a functional web page implemented with search bar that you can copy a bunch of texts and it will return the percentage of similarity between the texts and the articles in our database.
#### Discussion
There are seven points worth discussing. First, the search text can not include some special character because it will return unreasonable percentage due to normalization of the similarity result. Second, the response time is too long. Besides, the total amount of PDF file in our database is only eighty nine which is far less than ten thousand! There's also no hyperlink function in our web page. We don't have a PDF reader which the text inside can be clicked on. Harvard citation format. We don't have the source mentioned on Harvard citation format. There's also no classification function in our display web page.
#### Future Works
After knowing the problems in the discussion part, I think there are four points can be improved in the future. First, we can try to fix the strange percentage problems in the program. Second, we can try to build or find a PDF reader which can help us to fulfill the remaining user story. Besides, we need to enlarge our database from only eighty nine articles to ten thousand articles! We also need to come up with a method to shorten the response time! This is my presentation! Thanks for your attention.

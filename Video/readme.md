This is our user story, you can view it from the slide. As a researcher, I need a PDF reader, so I can click on a highlighted text. Then I can get the similar parts in decreasing order. Besides, the result should contain the title of the publication and its link to the publisherâ€™s full text PDF, so I can find the information about any part that interests me

# Subheadings
Hello everyone , I'm Paul from team RCPL. Now I am going to show you the tasks and the things we have done this year. Through this video, you can easily comprehend the things we have done this year. Let's get started!
#### User story
This is our user story, you can view it from the slide. As a researcher, I need a PDF reader, so I can click on a highlighted text. Then I can get the similar parts in decreasing order. Besides, the result should contain the title of the publication and its link to the publisherâ€™s full text PDF, so I can find the information about any part that interests me
#### NWWC circle
As you can see from the slide, this is our NWWC circle. Because of this circle, you can know the tasks we have done in chronological order. First, we build a search bar by using Django. Then, we can get the search result based on the search query. In order to have a user-friendly web page, we add some CSS program into it! Then we extend our database to 89 articles by manually downloading them from Internet. Finally, we can display the similarity percentage and build a good-looking result page.
#### Demonstation
Now I am going to demonstrate the things we have completed this year. First, I need to connect to the server. As you can see from the web page, this is our search bar. You can try to click on the "about", it will show you the tutorial about how to use it. After input the search string, you just need to click on the "search buttom" and it will display the search results!

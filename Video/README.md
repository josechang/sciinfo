# Introduction
This readme file contains the sources about the video which had been done by the all participants of the Scientific Information Gathering and Processing for Engineering Research course held by Professor Nordling at the National Cheng Kung University in the spring semester of 2017.

# Advice
The video was made according to professor's advice. The following is the advice came from professor Nordling:

1. Please ask yourself if you think the video make you want to use the service you built. I don't think it does.

2. What is the first question you have when you are evaluating a new web service? I think the question is what can it do for me?

3. What is the question coming to your mind when you hear that it consists of a search bar for articles? I think the question is why have they built a search bar for articles, it already exists?

4. How long are you willing to watch a video without knowing how it will benefit you? I am willing to spend 15 seconds, so you need to start by telling me what the web service does for me.

5. What is the difference between giving a presentation of your project and demonstrating the web service to attract users? You should make a video for demonstrating the web service to attract users and interest.

6. What did I say about presentation of your names in the feedback on your presentation? Please include your full names and put yourself in the centre, not me.

7. What make you continue to watch a video? What make you stop watching?

8. Why did you build this web service? What is your vision for it? What is your message? You need to have a clear message that can be expressed in 1 sentence.

9. Do you remember the TED talk about why, how, what? Please see it again and think about your message.

10. Why do you think I said a 5 minute video? I did it because short is good. Actually a 2 min video would be even better. Make sure you do not exceed the 5 min limit.

\section*{Task 1 -- Building up the database}
\label{task1}

Goal for this section is to build up a database which downloads articles from open access databases using web crawler or web robot. And setting up a system that can allow the users to access the data in our database.

\subsection*{Feature 1 --Administrator part}
\label{task1:feature1}

Study the behavior of the system with regard to its initial value and assess if the system is globally asymptotically stable.

\subsection*{Feature 2 -- Web Crawler}
\label{task1:feature2}

Study the behavior of the system with regard to its initial value and assess if the system is globally asymptotically stable.
 
\subsection*{Feature 3 -- User account}
\label{task1:feature3}

In this part, the main issue is how to create a user account that can connect between user and database. But the more important thing is to make sure database will not collapse by user who is not allowed to access to core part of database.

To protect the database system security and privilege, this study introduces two methods for user account, principle of least privilege and role-based access control respectively. The principle of least privilege, also known as the principle of minimal privilege, means giving a user account only those those privileges which are essential to that userâ€™s work \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege} (2016/03/16). The role-based access control is a policy neutral access control mechanism defined around privileges and roles. It can implement discretionary access control (DAC) or mandatory access control (MAC). The role-based access control is very easy to do user assignments as the components of this policy, such as role-permissions, etc. That is why it sometimes referred to as role-based security \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control} (2016/03/16). The information and resources would not in danger due to these two methods will filter user depend on their authority and only allow the legitimate user to access.

\subsection*{Feature 4 -- User Interface}
\label{task1:feature4}

Study the behavior of the system with regard to its initial value and assess if the system is globally asymptotically stable.

\subsection*{Feature 5 -- Data Storage and Search Methods}
\label{task1:feature5}

Study the behavior of the system with regard to its initial value and assess if the system is globally asymptotically stable.

\subsection*{Feature 6 -- Database Management Systems}
\label{task1:feature6}

Study the behavior of the system with regard to its initial value and assess if the system is globally asymptotically stable.

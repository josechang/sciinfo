\section*{Task 1 -- Building up the database}
\label{task1}

Goal for this section is to build up a database which downloads articles from open access databases using web crawler or web robot. And setting up a system that can allow the users to access the data in our database.

\subsection*{Feature 1 --Administrator part}
\label{task1:feature1}

Study the behavior of the system with regard to its initial value and assess if the system is globally asymptotically stable.

\subsection*{Feature 2 -- Web Crawler}
\label{task1:feature2}

Study the behavior of the system with regard to its initial value and assess if the system is globally asymptotically stable.
 
\subsection*{Feature 3 -- User account}
\label{task1:feature3}

Study the behavior of the system with regard to its initial value and assess if the system is globally asymptotically stable.

\subsection*{Feature 4 -- User Interface}
\label{task1:feature4}

Study the behavior of the system with regard to its initial value and assess if the system is globally asymptotically stable.

\subsection*{Feature 5 -- Data Storage and Search Methods}
\label{task1:feature5}

Study the behavior of the system with regard to its initial value and assess if the system is globally asymptotically stable.

\subsection*{Feature 6 -- Database Management Systems}
\label{task1:feature6}

Study the behavior of the system with regard to its initial value and assess if the system is globally asymptotically stable.

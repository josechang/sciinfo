	To achieve this goal, I need:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item configuration of a web server on epsilon,
  \item setup of an open-source database on epsilon containing PDFs,
  \item a collection of 10 000 PDFs manually downloaded from other databases (Or download automatically by web crawler),
  \item setup of an open source search engine that searches the XML files and return the html files,
  \item a website that include a search bar and can send the user query to the search engine and receive the result of the query and display it,
  \item a method to compare every keyword combinations in each sentence of an article with the database,
  \item rank the results of the comparison, put the result of the rank in decreasing order and displaying it on the new web page,
  \item APIs defining interfaces in the system ,
  \item UML diagrams of the system,
  \item documentation of the code, 
\end{enumerate}

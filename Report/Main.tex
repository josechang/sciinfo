	\section{Introduction}
	\label{Introduction}
	
	This technical report contains both general information on the state of the scientific information retrieval and processing art and a description of the \href{https://bitbucket.org/nordron/nordron-sciinfo}{Nordron-SciInfo} software package for information retrieval and processing. 
	This report was written by all participants of the \emph{Scientific Information Gathering and Processing for Engineering Research} course lead by Prof. Nordling at the National Cheng Kung University in the spring semester 2016. The main objectives of the course is to teach the students state of the art information retrieval and processing methods, project management, and technical writing by doing a project on implementation of some methods for retrieval and processing of full text scientific articles. The result of the student project is described in this report.
	
	\subsection{Aim and project structure}
	\label{aim}

	The whole project was separated into three parts, each with a responsible team:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Create a data base of open access full text articles (Team Wolverine).
		\item Create a complementary XML like structure for metadata that contains all information in the PDF and can be show in Utopia (Team Eagle unit).
		\item Automatic creation of metadata/markup by use of natural language processing of full text articles (Team Union).
		%\item Automatic creation of links from full text articles to external sources (Team Hanky Phanky).
	\end{enumerate}

1)	A Comparison of some Different Techniques for Vector Based Call-Routing:
•	approaches to vector-based call-routing.
•	dimensionality of the vectors
•	multi-edit and condense algorithm)

•	technique of singular value decomposition (SVD) to find the   lowest error representation of the matrix.
•	query is pre-processed into a vector
•	by transforming to a dimensionality
•	the number of “semantic units” is known a priori.
•	labelled training data

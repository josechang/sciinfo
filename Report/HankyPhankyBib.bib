Abstract = {{This article is centred on analysing the state of the art of the
   conflation processes applied to geospatial databases (GDBs) from
   heterogeneous sources. The term conflation is used to describe the
   procedure for the integration of these different data, and conflation
   methods play an important role in systems for updating GDBs, derivation
   of new cartographic products, densification of digital elevation models,
   automatic features extraction and so on. In this article we define
   extensively each conflation process, its evaluation measures and its
   main application problems and present a classification of all conflation
   processes. Finally, we introduce a bibliography which the reader may
   find useful to further explore the field. It tries to serve as a
   starting point and direct the reader to characteristic research in this
   area.}},

\section{Final Outcome}
\textit{\footnotesize Author:Bernie Huan, Jim Lan, Hoang Tan, Kenny Hsu, Rahul Aditya, Tan Phat, Wei.}\\
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Readable PDF on convenient software.
		\item User friendly format for searching.
		\item Free database contains 10k full text.
		\item The most important sentences can be viewed.
		\item Itâ€™s more convenient for readers by categorizing articles by fields.
	\end{enumerate}
	
\section{Work Break Structure(WBS)}
	\subsection*{Level 1}
	Website for search, read online and download.
	\subsection*{Level 2}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Database for 10k articles(PDF).
			\item Xml file with necessary  information.
			\item PDF which could show in Utopia.
			\item PDF which could show in Utopia.
		\end{enumerate}	
	\subsection*{Level 3}	
		\subsubsection*{Database}
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Web crawler.
				\item Sever.
				\item Management system.
			\end{enumerate}

\section*{Describe process}
	\subsection*{Journal name, Title, Authors, Abstract, Reference URL extraction}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Import some necessary packages.
			\item Convert PDF file into TXT file.
			\item Detect the Journal name, Title, Authors, Abstraction, Reference URL -database's words.
			\item Capture the Journal name, Title, Authors, Abstraction, Reference URL  in the TXT files by python.
			\item Output the Journal name, Title, Authors, Abstraction, Reference URL  of the article in TXT file.
		\end{enumerate}

	\subsection*{Search engine and API}
	The search sentence part or word is related to the search engine. 
	After extracting the necessary information, we have to find a way to search these data.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Convert PDF file into TXT file.
			\item Read the txt files by lines.
			\item The array is created to divide the section of the articles.
			\item The array is expanded to divide the section clearly.
			\item Users search the sentences, the program search all sections by this sentence.
			\item Output the result.
		\end{enumerate}

\section*{Result and Discussion}
	\subsection*{Journal name, Title, Authors, Abstract, Reference URL extraction}
	The result of these part, we tranfer to TXT file, you can see in figure.

	\subsection*{Search engine and API}
	Search engine have run, but we only apply with one PDF file and you can see the result in figure.

	We also attempt to produce an semi-automatic interface that help users to inquire certain information from our database. 
	Currently it allows user to search for abstracts, introduction, method, result, discussion, and reference. 
	We will continue develop the interface in the remaining week. 
	The objectives are either covering more functions or make the results pages has more professional appearance. 
	However, that being said when we still have enough time.

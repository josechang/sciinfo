\subsection{Webpage Construction}
\textit{\footnotesize Author : Chinweze Ubadigha, Feng-Chun Hsia, Henry Peng, I-Chieh Lin, Jones Hou, Piyarul Hoque, Ray Chang.}\\

We are going to construct a public, user friendly web site, which provide service of scientific article searching.
To achieve this goal, we seperate our responsibility into parts:\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item Build up the web server.
	The web server is built by Django. Django is web framework which can highly construct by Python.
	Consider the Django framework that PostgresSOL, Nginx, and Gunicorn are recommand to build as an database sever, web sever, 
	and Python WSGI HTTP Server, respectively.
	\item Build a web page with a search bar.
	\item Place a list on the webpage which showing the search results.
	\item Build a metadata schema which contains all information in a PDF and then edit it in an XML structure. 
	\item Build up the APIs. The search bar should send the search string and the result list to tje search system 
	then the system recieve the results of searching and display it.
\end{itemize}
This article will provide a review through the tools and methodologies we use to achieve each work.
\subsubsection{Web Server}
For any web page, a web server is necessary.
There are three web server system used in our project. 
They play the role as web page framework, reverse proxy server, 
and database management, respectively.
Consider the ease to use and learn, and the generality of Python language 
that we choose Django, a Python based web server system for our work.

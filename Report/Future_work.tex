\subsection{Future Work}
So far, our search web page have search function. After clicking the search icon, it can perform full text search through the PDF files in the database and extracts of the most similar parts in decreasing order. Besides, it can also diplay the title and its relevance on the result web page.

However, we don't perform the search function through a PDF reader. Instead, we do it on a web page which means we can not click on a highlighted text and thereby perform a full text search through the PDF reader. Therefore, for next step, it will be great to build or find a PDF reader which the strings inside the text can be clicked. Then, it will perform the full text search through the PDF files in the database. Then, the user story will be completed.

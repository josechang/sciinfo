\subsection{Search Settings}

So far our search system can only provide "single query" searching, which means the users can only search with a single keyword every time.
If multiple words was entered in the search bar, it will be processed as a single word.

Nowadays, almost every existing scientific article database provides multi-query and Boolean searching function,
to make it more convenient for the user to enter all possible key words,
and faster to convert the result.
To provide a more efficient information retrieve service,
multi-query search seems to be a necessary function.

\subsection{Search Result}
Providing more detail, generating the bibliography, and refine the search result are all common functions in existing scientific article searching services.
In our system, the result pages will display the title of all articles found and the percentage of similarity number compared with search query.
Moreover, there's a visualized figure which can plot chart diagram whose x-axis is range of similarity percentage and y-axis is how many articles in those range.
However, there's no function to operate or further limit the range of searching within the result.
For next step,
building up bibliography generating function and original publisher linking will be a good direction for improvement.

\subsection{Search Settings}

So far our search system can only provide "single query" searching, which means the users can only search with a \todo{Please use spell check!} sigle key word everytime.
If multiple words was entered in the search bar, it will be processed as a single word.

In nowadays, almost every existing sientific article database provide multi-query and Boolean searching function,
to make it more convenient for the user to enter all possible key words,
and faster to convert the result.
To provide a more efficient information retrieve service,
multi-query search seems to be a necessary function.

\subsection{Search Result}
Providing more detail, generating the bibliography, and refine the search result are all common functions in existing scientific article searching services.
IN our system, the result pages will display the metadata of all articles found very clearly.
However, it doesn't allow the user to sort the articles as their will. Also,
there's no function to operate or futher shrink the range of searching within the result.
For next step,
building up the sorting and bibliography generating will be a good direction to improve the result providing.

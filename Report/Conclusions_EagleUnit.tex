So far our search system can only provide "single query" searching, which means the users can only search with a sigle key word everytime. If multiple words was entered in the search bar, it will be processed as a single word.

In nowadays, almost every existing sientific article database provide multi-query and Boolean searching function,
to make it more convenient for the user to enter all possible key words, and faster to convert the result. To provide a more efficient information retrieve service, multi-query search seems to be a necessary function.

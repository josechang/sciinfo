\subsubsection{Different standards of metadata}
\label{sec:mets}
There's many different standards existing to describe the metadata in different fields and applications. We list 5 of them and give a brief introduction to each one.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item METS\\
	{\bf Introduction}\\
	Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS) similar to XML encoding format for storing the descriptive, administrative, structural and behavioral metadata needed to manage complex digital objects in open and standardized way.
	
	In 1990s, Making of America II (MOA2) project was proposed to share vision between national digital libraries which provides a means for the Digital Library Federation (DLF) to investigate, refine, and recommend metadata elements and encodings used to discover, display, and navigate digital archival objects. MOA2 DTD was created to test MOA2 project.
	
	However, MOA2 DTD was limited in several ways. It provided no flexibility in terms of the exact metadata elements to be used for descriptive, administrative and structural metadata. Also, limited in scope to support for text and still image materials and no attempt to support time-based media such as audio or video materials. To solve those problems led to the creation of METS.

	\item MARCXML\\
	{\bf Introduction}\\
	To make up the less of internet compatibility of MARC 21, the Library of Congress developed an XML schema based on it. Which the schema is the MARCXML standard. The purpose of MARCXML is to build a metadata format with a simple, extensible and flexible structure, which can be presented in XML stylesheets. Since MARCXML was design to converged data from MARC 21, the structure and performance are very similar between these two standards.  
	{\bf Adventage}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Used in XML directly
		\item Easily work with MARC 21 system.
	\end{enumerate}	
	{\bf Disadventage}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The disadventage of MARC 21 can be almost totally found on MARCXML, except the ability of internet apllication.
	\end{enumerate}
	{\bf Conclusion}\\
	Since our responsibility is to construct an XML schema, MARCXML will be our choice if MARC 21 becomes the standard we work with.

% 2. Necessary elements of XML metadata
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection*{2. Necessary elements of XML metadata with DTD}
\label{sec:mets}
{\bf Ruey-Shun}\cite{chen2003developing} suggest that an XML metadata discribed according the DTD include three necessary elements:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Structure\\
	The major execution ability of structure includes parser for well-formed XML and
	valid DTD structure, authoring tool for editing.
	
	\item Depth\\
	Basically, there are two sorts of fields: Fixed-length fields and variable fields.
	Fixed-length fields are general types and character-indication types Sub-field, whether
	fixed-length fields or variable fields, might contain both fixed-length fields and
	variable fields. According to the reason above, the process ability of the system has to
	cover the situation
	
	\item Scope\\
	The connections must involve simple object, time, space, people, and event. 
\end{enumerate}

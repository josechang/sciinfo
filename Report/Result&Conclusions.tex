\subsection{Results}
We already have an interesting and hard working course. In the  course, we build Django, build PostgreSQL database and develop search engine, after that we combine them together. Then, we can get the search result based on the search query. In order to have a user-friendly web page, we add some CSS program into it! We extend our database to 89 articles by manually downloading them from Internet. Finally, we can display the similarity percentage and build a good-looking result page.

In brief we now have a functional web page implemented with search bar that you can copy a bunch of texts and return the percentage of similarity between the texts and the articles in the database.

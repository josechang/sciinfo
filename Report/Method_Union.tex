\subsection*{Title extraction}
\item Using python to catch the title.
First step,in the beginning,we import some necessary packages such as NLTK and string...etc.  
Second step,we convert every PDF file we want to deal with into txt file and set the path and store them in specific folder.
Third step,ues regular expression in python to capture the first sentence in the txt files which have been convertrd and stored in specific folder in previous step. 
Fourth step, output the title of the article in txt file.   

\subsubsection*{Author extraction}


\subsubsection*{Abstract extraction}
\begin{itemize}
	\item I use the python to catch the abstract.
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{Union_Background_Chart_2}
	\end{center}
	\item Fist,the pdf is converted into txt file.Thus, it will create the txt file.\\ 
	\item Second,read the txt file on every line.If the python detects the abstract-database's words ,it will start to catch the sentences.\\ 	
	abstract-database:including the condition\\
	1. capital         "ABSTRACT"\\
	2. lower case      "abstract"\\
	3. in the sentence "Abstractâ€”Word sense ....."\\
	4. and so on \\
	\item Third,read the txt file on every line.If the python detects the abstract-database-stop's words ,it will stop to catch the sentences.\\ 
	abstract-database-stop:including the condition
	1. the blank line
	2. specific words in the beginning "Keywords"
	3. and so on
	\item Fourth,output the sentences in the txt file\\ 	
	
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Search sentences}
\begin{itemize}
	\item I use python to complete the task. 
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{Union_Background_Chart_2}
	\end{center}
	\item First,turn the PDF to the txt file .(Make the programe easy to read file)\\ 
	\item Second,read the txt file by lines.\\ 	
	\item Third,create the array to divide the section of the articles.\\ 	
	\item Forth,expend the array to divide the section clearly.\\ 	
	\item Fifth,Users search the sentence.The programe search all sections by this sentence.\\
	\item Sixth,Show the results\\  		
	
\end{itemize}

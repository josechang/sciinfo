\subsection{Web Server}
by combining Django, PostgreSQL, NGINX, and Gunicorn, a robust web server was build.
The Django provide a very convinient web page framework to modify the outlooks and finctions. 
For the database system, Postgres provide a much more powerful funnction and management then the default SQLite in Django.
By using Gunicor as an interface to the Django, NGINX makes the server more  fast and secured on communication with the internet requiests.
\subsection{Web Page}
The final design of the search setting page has a search bar and several fliters.
It allows users to enter the keywords, and decide which part of articles shoud the search system search in.
To display the articles found, we didn't shows them in the samepage with search settings in the end. Instead, a link to a new page displaying all the metadata of search results was created.

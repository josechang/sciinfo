		git clone https://bitbucket.org/nordron/nordron-sciinfo
		
* Step 3: Move into the repository.

		cd nordron-sciinfo

* Step 4: Pull the files.

		git pull
		
### Install pip ###

		sudo yum update
		sudo yum install python-pip
		sudo yum install epel-release		
	
### Convert pdfs into txts ###

* Step 1: Install pdfx.

		sudo pip install pdfx
		
* Step 2: Make directories called **Article_pdf** and **Article_txt** under Django/src.

		mkdir ~/nordron-sciinfo/Code/Django/src/Article_txt ~/nordron-sciinfo/Code/Django/src/Article_pdf/
		
* Step 3: Move into the directory **Article_pdf**.
		
		cd ~/nordron-sciinfo/Code/Django/src/Article_pdf/
		
	Check the files:
	
		ls		

* Step 4: Add pdf files to **Article_pdf** folder, you can use either FileZilla or scp command

* Step 5: Convert the pdf files to txt files.
		
		pdfx <filename>.pdf -t -o ../Article_txt/<filename>.txt
		
	or write a batch file with the following code and run it ($ source <filename>.sh) in directory **pdfs**.
	
		#!/bin/bash
		
		for f in *.pdf
		do
			echo "Converting $f"
			pdfx $f -t -o ../Article_txt/$(echo $f | cut -f 1 -d '.').txt
		done

	
	
### Install Django with Postgres, Nginx and Gunicorn in docker ###
		
* Step 1: Install Docker Engine
	
	Check if Docker has already been installed

		docker info

	if not install docker engine

		sudo yum -y install docker docker-registry
		sudo systemctl start docker

* Step 2: Install docker-compose

		pip install docker-compose


* Step 3: Configure the port with

		vim <Django directory>/docker-compose.yml
		
	find the following lines
	
		  nginx:
			image: nginx:latest
			container_name: ng02
			ports:
			  - "9000:7000"
			volumes:
			  - ./src:/src
			  - ./config/nginx:/etc/nginx/conf.d
			depends_on:
			  - web
			  
	then change "9000:7000" into "<port you want>:7000"
	e.g. "2345:7000"

* Step 4: For the first time setting up, run the following command to build up docker in your computer

		sudo docker-compose build

	Wait for a while before it finishes collecting the required packages.

* Step 5: Save the file and run

		sudo docker-compose up -depends_on

	if the above command is not working, use

        sudo docker-compose up -d

	instead.


* Step 6: Check your website at "localhost:<port you set>". For server version, enter "<your static IP address>:<port you set>".

* Step 7: Enter "localhost:<port you set>/update" to synchronize your database. For server version, change localhost to IP as Step 6 did.

* Step 8: If you make some change of this project in your computer, e.g. design of webpage, run the following command to restart docker in your computer

		sh <Django directory>/restartDocker.sh
		
		
## For Windows and Mac OS users ##

### Set up git ###

* Step 1: Install git client software, you can choose either [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) or [Git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

* Step 2: Clone this repository (Don't know how? In the top right corner of this page you can see a "Clone wiki" button, press it.)

* Step 3: Learn how to use git by doing the 15 minuts interactive git tutorial here: [15 Minutes GIT tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) AND by checking out [this page](https://bitbucket.org/temn/nordlinglab-web/wiki/git_and_ssh) under "Command Line Session":  

### Set up pip ###

* Step 1: Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

* Step 2: Open command line (Windows - [here a list of commands](https://www.lifewire.com/list-of-command-prompt-commands-4092302))/ terminal (Mac) and type ```pip``` ([difference between Unix and Win commands](https://www.lemoda.net/windows/windows2unix/windows2unix.html))

* Step 3: If ```pip``` cannot work, you need to set the environment variable.

### Convert pdfs into txts ###

* Step 1: Install pdfx.

		pip install pdfx
		
* Step 2: Make directories called **Article_pdf** and **Article_txt** under Django/src. (Note: if your directory is on another drive than C:, use e.g. e:\<path to folder>)

		mkdir <path to this repository>\Code\Django\src\Article_txt <path to this repository>\Code\Django\src\Article_pdf\
		
* Step 3: Move into the directory **Article_pdf**. (Note: if your director is on another drive, use cd /d d:\<path to directory>\Code\Django\src\Article_pdf\)
		
		cd <path to this repository>\Code\Django\src\Article_pdf\
		
	Check the files:
	
		dir

* Step 4: Add pdf files to **Article_pdf** folder, you can use either FileZilla or scp command. If you're using local computer, just do copy and paste

* Step 5: Convert the pdf files to txt files.
		
		pdfx <filename>.pdf -t -o ../Article_txt/<filename>.txt
		
	or write a batch script with the following code and run it in directory **pdfs**.
		
		#!/bin/bash
		for f in *.pdf
		do
			echo "Converting $f"
			pdfx $f -t -o ../Article_txt/$(echo $f | cut -f 1 -d '.').txt
		done


### Set up docker ###

* Step 1: Install [Docker toolbox for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/)/[Docker toolbox for Mac OS](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_mac/). If you cannot setup Docker toolbox successfully, please check your virtual machine's version whether it is the newest one.
	
	For newer versions of Windows 10 (Pro versions or Creator's Update) do as follows:
	
	a) Install [Docker Community Edition](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) (not Docker Toolbox)
	
	b) Enable Hyper-V by Open Control Panel -> System and Security -> Programs (left panel) -> Turn Windows features on or off -> Check the Hyper-V box. If you don't have Hyper-V option, then your Windows OS is not Enterprise Edition. Also, Docker seems to work a lot better on Intel processors (not AMD).
	
	c) Add C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\resources\bin to Path in Environmental Variables. To do so, in Search (Windows Buttton), search for and then select: System (Control Panel), click the Advanced system settings link. Click Environment Variables. In the section System Variables, find the PATH environment variable and select it. Click Edit. If the PATH environment variable does not exist, click New. In the Edit System Variable (or New System Variable) window, specify the value of the PATH environment variable. Click OK. Close all remaining windows by clicking OK.
	
	d) IMPORTANT: get sure you share your drives. In the task bar, right click on the docker icon (if it isn't there, it means docker service is not running and you should start from step 1 again) and select settings. In the settings windo select on the left side "Shared Drives", select the drive on which you downloaded the git files, type in your Windows password to confirm.
	
	e) IGNORE step 2 and 3, just do step 4, 5 and 6, then go to your browser (Firefox, Chrome) and type "localhost:YOUR_IP_FROM_STEP_4" (without the "") and voilï¿½, you should be done. (no need for step 7 and 8)
	
* Step 2: Launch Docker toolbox and wait until it finish setting up

* Step 3: Type the command ```docker-machine ip``` to get the ip of Docker.

* Step 4: Configure the port with

		vim <Django directory>/docker-compose.yml
		
	find the following lines
	
		  nginx:
			image: nginx:latest
			container_name: ng02
			ports:
			  - "9000:7000"
			volumes:
			  - ./src:/src
			  - ./config/nginx:/etc/nginx/conf.d
			depends_on:
			  - web
			  
	then change "9000:7000" into "<port you want>:7000"
	e.g. "2345:7000"

* Step 5: For the first time setting up, run the following command to build up docker in your computer

		docker-compose build

	Wait for a while before it finishes collecting the required packages.

* Step 6: Save the file and run

		docker-compose up

	if the above command works well, after restarting you can also use

        docker-compose up -d

	instead.
	
	Note that ```-d``` is to make it run in background.
	
* Step 7: Check your website at "<ip for docker-machine>:<port you set>"

* Step 8: Enter "<ip for docker-machine>:<port you set>/update" to synchronize the database.
